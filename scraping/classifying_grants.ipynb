    "Match past grants to faculty profiles by merging dataframes\n",

    "- Will give us a training set for us to classify grants as expertise fields\n",

    "\n",
    "Streamline of data (for a live system):\n",
    "- Grants\n",
    "    - grants.gov\n",
    "    - Pivot has more grants but has a no data mining policy (which is a problem if this system is used by Berkeley)\n",
    "- Faculty Profiles\n",
    "    - vcresearch.berkeley.edu\n",
    "    - internal source of data that is not public (past research/grants given)\n",

    "### Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Faculty Profile creation (goal: try to come up with a list of categories/hidden traits about grants/research that the faculty LIKE and DISLIKE):\n",
    "- Field they are in/Department/Specialities\n",
    "    - Do people in the field generally like certain things?\n",
    "        -Government as their sponsor/want lots of grant money/cross-research/etc\n",
    "- Past research\n",
    "    - Analyze content of research news/name of research/categories of research\n",
    "    - Do they do cross-field research?\n",
    "    - Cost of grants of past research\n",
    "    - Change over time of research concentration (ex. very first was bio, then bio tech, then tech)\n",
    "    - Who did they work with/their fields of research\n",
    "- Years of being a faculty/researcher (might make them more set on a certain field like Abbeel)\n",
    "\n",
    "Grants classification (goal: besides list of categories/find hidden traits):\n",
    "- Category of funding\n",
    "- Grant money\n",
    "- Who is sponsoring (government, non-profit, etc), can find out from sponsor and possible email address (.gov)\n",
    "- Elgibility check\n",
    "- Get sentiment/hidden categories from opportunity title/description\n",
