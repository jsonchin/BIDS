We study the molecular mechanisms that regulate sperm motility, chemotaxis and the acrosome reaction. A better understanding of these processes will lead to the development of novel approaches to control and preserve male fertility, improve the human reproductive health worldwide and advance family planning. Co-immunostaining of human spermatozoa with anti-Hv1 antibody (green flagella), anti-COX-IV antibody (red mitochondria) and DAPI (blue nuclei) Human spermatozoon (a), human sperm flagellum (b) and mouse spermatozoon (c) attached to the recording pipette Current Projects On its route to the egg inside the female reproductive tract, mammalian spermatozoa encounter multiple barriers: a viscous cervical mucus, cervical and uterine immune responses, the very narrow lumen of the uterotubal junction, the sticky and extremely complex maze formed by the epithelial folds of the Fallopian tubes, and finally the thick protective glycoprotein envelope (zona pellucida or ZP) of the egg itself. In order to overcome these numerous barriers and eventually fertilize the egg, the sperm cell must sense the cues released by the egg and change its swimming behavior. Sperm can achieve this by increasing the amplitude and driving force of their tail beating, change their direction of movement, and release special enzymes to dissolve the ZP. Such sperm responses depend upon electrical activity of the spermatozoon's plasma membrane which undergoes region-specific changes in ionic permeability in the female reproductive tract. Permeability of the sperm plasma membrane is controlled by ion channels. Ion channels are specialized integral membrane proteins that form ion-conducting pores in normally non-conducting membranes. Ion channels of the sperm cell open in response to environmental cues of the female reproductive tract, thus changing conductance of the sperm plasma membrane and sperm behavior. The physiological importance of sperm ion channels has inspired numerous attempts to identify and characterize them. However, for about 20 years, these attempts had been frustrated by the inability to apply methods of contemporary biology to the sperm cells due to their small size, specific morphology and vigorous motility. The recently introduced sperm patch clamp technique has, in just a few years, produced a gigantic leap in our understanding of sperm ion channels. We use this method to study sperm ion channels and to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning sperm-egg interaction and the environment of the female reproductive tract during the process of fertilization. This will help us to understand more about the early beginning of life, open new avenues in treatment of male infertility, and create novel male-specific or unisex contraceptives.

This approach requires that we employ a wide variety of techniques, including paleontological, geological, and biogeographical data, along with comparative morphology, developmental biology, long-term experimental manipulations, phylogenetic studies, and molecular techniques. My systematic work features the Patellogastropoda, a basal group of gastropod molluscs that figure prominently in ecological studies of rocky shores around the world. We use phylogenetic hypotheses to understand adaptation and evolution in patellacean faunas around the world and through time. I also remain interested in the role of substrates in determining and augmenting community composition. Some effort in our lab is also directed at understanding the evolutionary history of California land snail taxa as well. I also investigate relationships amongst higher molluscan taxa including subclades within the Gastropoda, the \"conchiferian\" groups, and the phyletic position of the Mollusca on the Tree of Life. A recurrent theme in many of these studies is the role of heterochrony, especially in the evolution of morphology, life history strategies, and reproductive systems in molluscs. This work focuses on the intersections of phylogeny and development using different developmental data sets and tools and comparisons across levels of organization and the phylogenetic hierarchy. Research topics selected by my graduate students are often outside my own areas of interest, but share a phylogenetic framework, include fossil as well as living organisms as study taxa, and are concerned with the nearshore marine environment.

I arrived there in the middle of the Miners\\' Stike in 1984 to study as an undergraduate and stayed there to do a PhD, hold a postdoctoral fellowship, and eventually get a job. I moved to Berkeley in 2000. I am a historian of modern Britain with broad comparative and theoretical interests in the relationship between local, national, imperial and global histories.

History 285 : Modern Imperial Britain Those interested in scholarly events relating to Britain should check out the Center for British Studies . Trained as a political historian of nineteenth century Britain, my first publications - Politics and the People ([1993] splendidly reissued in paperback in 2009 ) and an edited collection of essays Re-Reading the Constitution (1996) - helped outline an agenda for what a cultural history of British politics might look like. In particular, they addressed the cultural practices and forms of subjectivity upon which the British version of democracy relied during the nineteenth century. My next book Hunger. A Modern History (2007) explored how and why hunger came to be understood as a problem and the changing ways in which it was addressed by civil society and the state in imperial Britain. It was also an attempt to imagine what social history and histories of welfare might look like after the cultural and imperial turns. A collection of essays The Peculiarities of Liberal Modernity in Imperial Britain , co-edited with Simon Gunn in honor of our graduate adviser Patrick Joyce, was published in 2011. My next book Distant Strangers. How Britain Became Modern (2014) sought to develop an account of modernity rooted in singular social conditions rather than the logic of capitalism. I have just completed an unusually argumentative textbook which will be published in Spring 2017 as part of a new Cambridge History of Britain series, my volume is Modern Britain, 1750 to the Present . AnNEH funded project on the making of homo economicus and the nature of neoliberalism in late twentieth century Britain has given rise to the begining of a new book idea about the global history of late Britain told through Heathrow Airport. I am a co-editor of the Berkeley Series in British Studies published by theUniversity of California Press and am on the editorial boards of Social History , Twentieth Century British History , History Compass and the Journal of British Studies . Although I have not won nearly enough prestigious fellowships or prizes my research has been supported by the British Academy, the ESRC, the ACLS and the NEH. I am a board member of the Berkeley Faculty Association and am broadly interested in the neoliberal transformation of our universities and its consequences for us all, but especially for undergraduate and graduate students.

An active scholar in the growing subfield of \"Latin America in the World,\" her work explores the intersections between international and domestic politics in the Americas in the twentieth century. She is currently working on her first book, a social and political history of “cooperation in security” between Latin America and the United States that is centered on the pivotal experience of U.S. military basing in Latin America during World War II. Focusing on Brazil, Cuba, and Panama, Herman finds that though Latin American sovereignty was preserved in principle in cooperative diplomatic agreements, local events in courtrooms, on picket lines, outside of U.S.O. clubs and inside red light districts precipitated debates over the practical meaning of sovereignty in the everyday lives of ordinary Latin Americans. Latin American leaders’ efforts to resolve local conflicts on the international stage illuminate larger transformations that took place during the war in the relationship between international aid, military power and domestic politics in Latin America. Prior to entering academia, Herman spent several years in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Brazil working as a freelance translator, researcher and documentarian. Before joining the faculty at Berkeley, Herman was Assistant Professor of International Studies and Latin American Studies at the University of Washington, Seattle. She has received fellowships and awards from the Mellon Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, the Social Science Research Council, and the Council on Library and Information Resources, among others. She received her Ph.D. from Berkeley and her B.A. from Duke.

       " 'Andrew Dillin': \"Andrew Dillin Contact Info Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and Thomas and Stacey Siebel Distinguished Chair in Stem Cell Biology and  Professor of Genetics, Genomics and Development Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/dillin/ Full Directory Information Research Interests As an organism ages, its proteins face an increasing severity in the challenges they receive from extrinsic and intrinsic environmental perturbation. Chaperones become dysregulated, while the degradation machineries stop working properly. The protein accumulates damage and starts to misfold. At this point, the cell needs to mount a response to restore its homeostasis; however, the stress response machinery that it typically relies upon when faced with such challenges has lost its capacity to function. This breakdown, however, does not lead to complete disorder. As the organism ages, it exhibits a degree of correlated, recognizable, and predictable changes to its physiology over time. These changes can occur synchronously across multiple tissues and organs. The phenotypic changes of aging occur in a type of concert, rather than in isolation, suggesting the residual participation of the endocrine system in the onset of age-related phenotypes. The demise of the cell thus most often occurs within the context of the simultaneous demise of the whole organism. Our lab focuses on the questions of why an aging organism begins to lose control over the integrity of its proteome, and how this loss is communicated across its various tissues. To accomplish this, we have taken the approach of breaking down a cell into its small and canonically-autonomous parts – its suborganelles and subcompartments – such that we can take a larger step back to ask how those smaller portions can communicate both with each other and with the organism as a whole. Our approaches have required us to diversify the systems in which we ask questions: we work on model systems ranging from stem cells and nematodes to mice. We have developed and applied techniques that allow us to manipulate signaling pathways or proteins within a single tissue, cell, or an organelle within a single cell so that we can observe how that small perturbation might reverberate and effect the physiology of the whole of the organism. Our work is fundamentally grounded in the endocrinology and genetics of aging, and our larger goal is to apply our findings towards uncovering new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of age-related pathologies. Current Projects The Communication of Mitochondrial Proteotoxic Stress Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported as a cause or as a consequence of nearly every single age-onset human disease. Recent work within our lab suggests that mitochondria potentially communicate or actively signal to regulate one another's activity between tissues. We have found that a tissue-specific mitochondrial stress can be sensed and transmitted to distal cells, invoking a cell non-autonomous mitochondrial stress response that extends life span. We are now working toward understanding the source and nature of this signal and the functional and morphological consequences of its signaling. The Communication of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is responsible for the folding and maturation of up to as many as 13 million proteins per minute. Challenges to the ER folding environment can have a multitude of consequences on an organism’s viability: defects in ER function are strongly associated with a large number of metabolic and age-onset disorders. We wish to understand how ER stress is signaled and perceived throughout the organism as it ages, and the extent to which such signaling is conserved in vertebrates. The Function of Cytoplasmic Heat Shock Response in Aging We have an additional team within the lab working on stress responses of the cytoplasm. The idea behind this work is to understand how the cytoplasmic stress responses might affect proteome maintenance and the rate of aging of the entire organism. The master regulator of the cytoplasmic stress response is the transcription factor HSF-1. We have isolated a hypermorphic variant of HSF-1 that can dramatically extend the life span of the nematode and increase thermotolerance. Paradoxically, it does not result in a canonical upregulation of the downstream chaperone network typically ascribed to the achievement of these phenotypes. Recently, we have created a mouse model in which HSF-1 is constitutively activated in the CNS, and we are actively working to understand HSF-1’s effects on proteotoxic stress in this background. Importantly, this body of work may reveal novel aspects of heat shock regulation, conserved from worms to mice, that function independently of chaperone induction. Stem Cells, Nutrient Availability and the Aging Process The extreme pressure that evolution places on reproductive success has long suggested that resources will be allocated differently across cell types: for example, to ensure that the germline retains a pristine health that assures the survival of the organism’s progeny, resources required for a heightened maintenance of cellular defenses must be upregulated. Elimination of reproduction would conversely signal the upregulation of defense mechanisms in somatic tissue, and dietary restriction is likewise thought to re-appropriate resources from reproduction towards somatic cell defenses. We thus hypothesize that germline cells (such as human embryonic stem cells) or nutrient-deprived cells might exhibit a heightened capacity to ensure proteostasis and thereby avoid protein damage. Accordingly, we have invested a considerable amount of effort in understanding how the proteome of stem and germ cells can remain pristine. Our work has focused on the functional consequences of the upregulation of the proteasome found in these cells. In parallel projects, we have found that genetic manipulation of specific receptors in olfactory neurons in both mice and worms is sufficient to increase health span and longevity, and are actively working to uncover the genetic signaling pathway underlying this response. Our lab has also discovered a highly conserved transcription factor, PHA-4, required for dietary restriction in C. elegans. We believe that this protein forms a core-signaling pathway that responds to and integrates an organism's response to reduced caloric intake. We are thus working toward understanding the molecular mechanism by which this pathway perceives and interprets the environmental signals that ultimately result in increased longevity. Understanding the Effects of Aging on the Translatome We are actively working on applying emergent technologies to manipulate and analyze the workings of the translational apparatus throughout the whole organism and within specific tissues. Significantly, this includes the establishment of ribosome profiling methodologies in worms and in stem cells. These techniques will allow us to dissect translation at a nucleotide resolution as it occurs, and will provide fundamental insights into the effects of aging on the rate, pausing, and non-coding start sites of translation. Significantly, this system will allow us the capacity to both temporally and spatially disect apart the contributions of stress responses to changes in the translatome.

       " 'Ehud Isacoff': 'Ehud Isacoff Contact Info Professor of Neurobiology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/isacoff/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Work in the lab is focused in four intersecting areas: a) Mechanisms of ion channel function, b) Synapse development and plasticity, c) Neural circuit function, and d) Design of novel probes for the optical detection and manipulation of neuronal signaling. The projects all involve optical spectroscopy, imaging and electrophysiology. Current Projects A) Allosteric control of channel and enzyme gates. Ion channels respond to physiological signals by opening and closing molecular gates that control the flow of ions across the membrane. Our goal is to understand the general principles of operation of voltage and ligand-gated channels. Our approach combines electrophysiology with biochemical probing and spectroscopy to detect conformational changes in the moving parts of the channels during identified functional transitions, and to apply force to those moving parts in order to understand the mechanical coupling of sensor domains to gates or one sensor domain to another, and thus to investigate the mechanism of allosteric control of gating. At the heart of the effort are two methods, which we developed. The first is Voltage Clamp Fluorometry (VCF) ( Mannuzzu et al., Science 271, 213-16, 1996; Glauner et al., Nature 402, 813-17 , 1999) . In VCF channel proteins are labeled site-specifically with fluorescent dyes and the structural rearrangements of the labeled segment of the channel are detected, in real-time, as changes in the fluorescence of environmentally-sensitive probes or FRET between donor-acceptor pairs. This is done in a native cellular environment under voltage clamp, at the ensemble and single molecule level, enabling specific protein motions to be associated with particular functional transitions. We are using the approach to study how protein motions in sensing domains that detect voltage or neurotransmitter ligands allosterically control the gates of channels or the activity of the catalytic site of a voltage-gated lipid phosphatase. The second method is single molecule TIRFM imaging in live cell membranes of single protein complexes in which subunits are fused to fluorescent proteins and their number is determined by counting steps of photobleaching (Ulbrich and Isacoff, Nature Methods 4, 319-21, 2007). This is being used to determine the subunit composition of channels and receptors and their interaction with regulatory proteins. B) Synaptic function and plasticity. Activity-dependent and independent mechanisms regulate synaptic size and strength to ensure a balance between excitation and inhibition of inputs and between input and output. This appears to be accomplished by integrated postsynaptic adjustment of synaptic receptors and retrograde signaling back to the presynaptic cell to adjust neurotransmitter release. The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are not known. We are studying these processes in dissociated mouse brain neurons and brain slice, at the model glutamatergic synapse of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction and in zebrafish in vivo . We are using two tools developed in the lab. The first is a postsynaptic targeted calcium sensor, which exclusively detects calcium influx through postsynaptic glutamate receptors thereby making it possible to image synaptic transmission at quantal resolution, enabling us to determine precisely the release properties of single active zones and define their mechanism of plasticity (Peled and Isacoff, 2011). The second method involves optical manipulation of chemically engineered glutamate receptors (D, below) to determine the activity dependence of the retrograde transmission. C) Neural circuit function in zebrafish. We are studying the development of function of neural circuits in zebrafish. The work combines remote control of action potential firing and synaptic signaling combined with imaging of activity with genetically encoded calcium and voltage sensors and electrophysiology. Our emphasis so far has been to identify spinal neurons that regulate the central pattern generator for swimming (Wyart et al., 2009), the development of the swim circuit (Warp et al., 2012), and the visual detection of prey (Del Bene et al., 2010). D) Novel probes for the optical detection and manipulation of neuronal signaling. Fluorescent indicator dyes have revolutionized our understanding of cellular signaling. Chemical indicators have been very powerful, but are limited in scope because they cannot be targeted to specific cell types or locations within a cell. Our solution for this problem has been to make sensors from proteins--the very biological molecules that transduce, transmit and receive cellular signals. This includes genetically encoded optical sensors of membrane potential and of synaptic transmission and new tools for the optical manipulation of neuronal activity. The ability to artificially stimulate and inhibit neurons is important for investigating how they contribute to the function of neural circuits. Our goal is to develop new ways to regulate neuronal activity by creating ion channels that are regulated by light. Because light can be applied rapidly and accurately, this approach offers great promise even for neurons that communicate using sparse temporal codes. The functional switch consists of a tethered ligand containing a photo-isomerizable prosthetic group. Different wavelengths of light either increase or decrease the length of the tether, thus regulating the probability that the ligand will reach its binding site. Several strategies make it possible to change the sign of light-activated neural response (i.e. inhibition vs. excitation) and the location within the cell where the current is induced. We have already made K+ channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors that are gated by light (Banghart et al., 2004; Volgraf et al., 2006; Gorostiza et al., 2007; Numano et al., 2009) and shown that these can be used to study the circuits underlying behavior of flies (unpublished) and zebrafish (Szobota et al., 2007; Wyart et al., 2009; Janovjak et al., 2010). Along with the labs of John Flannery and Rich Kramer, we have begun to introduce these light-gated channels to surviving neuronal layers in retinas of mouse models of human blinding diseases in which photoreceptor cells degenerate in effort to restore vision (Caporale et al., 2011). We are now expanding the toolset to other channels, GPCRs and enzymes involved in synaptic plasticity.

       " 'Terry Machen': 'Terry Machen Contact Info Professor of the Graduate School Division of Cell and Developmental Biology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/machen/ Full Directory Information Research Interests The general goal is to determine how cytoplasmic and organellar Ca, pH and redox contribute to physiology and pathophysiology of secretory epithelial cells. Current Projects The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel that conducts Cl, HCO 3 and glutathione (GSH). This channel is normally located in the apical membrane of trachea and other secretory and absorptive epithelial cells. The genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in CFTR that lead to reduced function of CFTR, resulting in altered luminal ionic milieu, accumulation of viscous mucus with altered biochemical properties, reduced activities of anti-bacterial products secreted by epithelial cells and accumulation of bacteria and neutrophils in affected tissues. Patch clamp and transepithelial electrophysiology are used to investigate the Cl and HCO 3 permeability properties of the CFTR channel, which is key to determining the secretory and absorptive properties of epithelial cells in the lung airways. To test the hypothesis that CFTR controls or modulates pH and redox of the airway surface liquid and organelles (ER, Golgi, and mucus secretory granules), we use digital imaging microscopy and genetic targeting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and organic fluorescent dyes to determine how the channel affects the pH regulatory properties of organelles in intact, living cells. Widefield and confocal microscopy coupled with measurements of are used to characterize the interactions between epithelial cells and bacteria in an attempt to determine the early events that precede inflammatory events like invasion by neutrophils. One of the key events in CF and other inflammatory diseases is that bacteria that accumulate in the airways induce neutrophils to migrate from the capillaries across the epithelial surface and into the airway lumen to attack the foreign invaders. The epithelilal cells appear to help orchestrate this event.

       " 'Hitoshi Murayama': 'Research Area(s): Particle Physics Biography Hitoshi Murayama is a well-known theoretical particle physicist who works broadly, even on astrophysics, cosmology, and condensed matter physics. He has been a professor in the University of California, Berkeley, since 2000, and is also the founding director of the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU) at the University of Tokyo since 2007. Born in Japan, lived in Germany for four years and in the US for 21 years, served on advisory committees in around the world, he is a multi-cultural global denizen. In October 2014, he was invited to give a speech at the United Nations headquarters in New York about how science unites people and brings peace. He received the Yukawa Commemoration Prize in Theoretical Physics and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Research Interests I am working on particle physics, trying to understand the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces acting among them. The so-called \"Standard Model\" of particle physics is very successful, and the Higgs boson, which is the \"core\" of the Standard Model, is supposed to be discovered this decade. However, there are still many problems which remain unanswered even with a future discovery of the Higgs boson. Why are there so many \"elementary\" particles, repeating three generations which have identical properties except their masses? Why are there three (electromagnetic, weak and strong) forces acting on elementary particles in a seemingly random manner? Why does Higgs boson exist and play such a special role? Why is the Universe so long-lived and has more matter than anti-matter in it? Recently, two important questions were added to the list. The Universe appears to be accelerating its expansion. Why? The neutrinos are supposed to be completely massless in the Standard Model, but recent indications of neutrino oscillations strongly suggest that they have small but finite masses. How? These puzzling phenomena must be clues to what is really going on at the most fundamental level in Nature. Using these clues, studying them in detail and ask what is behind is the approach in most of my research. Current Projects I’m struggling with the question how we can understand the small but finite value of the cosmological constant. One of the important question is the so-called \"Why Now?\" question, why we seem to live at the special moment in the history of Universe where the matter energy density is the same as that of the cosmological constant within a factor of two. Together with Nima Arkani-Hamed, Lawrence Hall, and our former postodoc Chris Kolda, we pointed out that there is a triple coincidence of energy densities including the radiation. Such a coincidence must have an explanation. We further pointed out that, if the cosmological constant is tied to the scale of electroweak physics as TeV2/MPl, the triple coincidence is an inevitable consequence, explaining \"Why Now.\" I believe this sheds important light on the origin of cosmological constant. The way the electroweak scale and cosmological constant are connected remains to be a major puzzle. Another important question is if the acceleration of Universe is really due to the cosmological constant. Together with my ex-student Alex Friedland and our postdoc Maxim Perelstein, I study if alternative forms of Dark Energy are consistent with cosmological observations and particle-physics constraints. Neutrino oscillations had been studied over many decades, but my ex-students André de Gouvêa, Alexander Friedland and I had found that past analyses of data covered only a half of the parameter space (\"the light side\"). The other half (\"the dark side\") can actually explain the current data on solar neutrinos, and had been completely missed in the literature. I continue active studies on how we attack the problems of neutrino masses. For example, Lawerence Hall, his student Neal Weiner, and I pointed out that a near-maximal mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillation, often regarded as the most puzzling feature, may well be a consequence of randomness in parameters. We called it \"anarchy.\" My current student Aaron Pierce and I showed how near future neutrino experiments can pin down on oscillation parameters. The future in this area appears very bright. The origin of small neutrino masses may well be connected to the question why there appears to be only matter but no anti-matter in Universe. Most explanations to the current puzzles require physics at much shorter distance scales than the electroweak scale 10–16 cm, possibly the Planck scale 10-–33 cm. Naïve estimates of quantum corrections suggest such a hierarchy in distance scales is unstable. Supersymmetry is probably the most promising way to stabilize the hierarchy. The mechanism of supersymmetry breaking has consequences on collider experiments to string theory. Gian Giudice, Markus Luty, I, and Riccardo Rattazzi had found a contribution to supersymmetry breaking from subtle quantum effects called anomalies, overlooked for two decades. These contributions revive some of the past unsuccessful attempts in model building, and pause new questions. Publications N. Arkani-Hamed, L. J. Hall, C. Kolda, and H.

Research projects in Professor Tilley's group involve exploratory synthetic, structural, and reactivity studies on novel inorganic and organometallic systems. Reactivity studies focus on compounds that exhibit unusual electronic and/or coordination environments for the metal center, and discovery of new chemical transformations. Reactivity studies are guided by mechanistic investigations that shed light on how reactions proceed. Metal-mediated routes to new polymers are being explored, and molecular, chemical approaches to the designed construction of advanced solid state materials and heterogeneous catalysts are being developed. Organometallic Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis Research in organometallic chemistry involves the synthesis of transition metal complexes that exhibit new chemical properties, often via the design and introduction of new ancillary ligands. Work with early transition metals and the f metals target coordinatively unsaturated complexes that activate small molecules via sigma-bond metathesis. In previous work with Zr, Hf, Sc, and Lu, catalytic transformations of Si-H and C-H bonds have been developed. In late transition metal systems, chelating, nitrogen-donor ligands are being explored in attempts to generate reactive metal centers. In particular, research with Rh, Ir, and Pt has led to discovery of new reactions for the hydroarylation and hydroamination of olefins. A further interest concerns the activation of bonds via 1,2-migrations between a metal and a donor atom. This reaction type, which produces a metal-ligand multiple bond, has been used to obtain silylene complexes of Pt, Ir, Ru, Os, and W. These investigations have led to discovery of a new mechanism for the hydrosilylation of olefins, mediated by a metal silylene complex. Organic Materials This program targets new electronic materials, and supramolecular structures constructed from labile C-C bonds. Polymer syntheses involve metal-mediated polymerizations of alkene, alkyne, silane, and/or stannane monomers. An emphasis is placed on development of electron-delocalized polymers, which show promise as advanced materials that function as conductors, semiconductors, photoconductors and light-emitting materials. Metal-catalyzed dehydropolymerizations have been used to obtain the first high molecular weight polystannanes. These low band-gap polymers are semiconducting when doped, and display interesting temperature-dependent optical properties. An approach to new pi-conjugated structures is based on the zirconocene-coupling of diynes to polymers with zirconacyclopentadiene units in the main chain. The metallacyclic monomer units provide versatile chemical pathways for placement of various conjugated groups (dienes, aromatic heterocycles) into a delocalized chain. Related methods are being used to obtain oligomeric and small-molecule organic materials that possess high electron affinities, n-type semiconducting properties, and high electron mobilities. These molecules are being constructed by zirconocene-coupling methods, and by nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions of fluorinated aromatic systems. A related topic is based on the discovery that zirconocene-coupling methods are useful in high-yield syntheses of macrocycles and cages, from readily available diynes. This method, which relies on the reversibility of C-C bond formation in the couplings, is being used to produce assemblies of controlled size, shape, and functionality. Applications in host-guest chemistry, catalysis, anion binding, and supramolecular chemistry are being developed. Materials Chemistry and Heterogeneous Catalysis A project on the molecular design and synthesis of solid-state materials is based on development of chemical routes to complex, 3-dimensional networks via molecular-level control. Primary targets are multi-component, oxygen-containing materials which are fabricated from tailored, oxygen-rich precursor molecules. This approach has been used to obtain new catalysts for selective hydrocarbon oxidations. Related molecular precursors are used to introduce isolated catalytic sites onto the surface of an oxide support. Advantages to the latter method include the increased potential for molecular-level control over structure, the generation of site-isolated catalytic centers, and the availability of good spectroscopic models for the catalytic site. Further efforts employ chemical modifications of the catalyst support surface to enhance binding and activation of substrates, and release of products. New efforts in the Tilley group are coordinated with the Solar Energy Research Center at LBNL (Helios), for development of efficient routes to renewable chemical fuels from solar energy. Primary objectives include identification of inexpensive, efficient catalysts that drive energetically uphill reactions in the conversion of stable feedstocks (e.g., water and CO2) to potential fuels (e.g., hydrogen and hydrocarbons). Current research is directed toward identification of soluble and surface-bound catalysts for water oxidation and proton reduction. Biography Born 1954; B.S.

       " 'Gabriel Orebi Gann': \"Research Area(s): Nuclear Physics Particle Physics Biography Gabriel attended the University of Cambridge in the UK from 2000 to 2004, where she received her BA and MSci in Natural Sciences. She went on to the University of Oxford, and was awarded her DPhil in Particle and Nuclear Physics in 2008. Her post-doctoral research was performed at the University of Pennsylania, in Professor Klein's research group, working on SNO and its successor, the SNO+ experiment. Gabriel joined the U.C. Berkeley facuty in 2012. Research Interests I am an experimental particle physicist, with an interest in weakly interacting particles. My research focuses on neutrinos and dark matter - which is about as weakly interacting as you can get! My primary experimental involvement is in the SNO+ neutrino experiment, located 2km underground in an active nickel mine in northern Ontario, Canada. SNO+ is the successor to the extremely successful SNO experiment, on which I did my thesis work, which resolved the long-standing solar neutrino problem by observing the interactions of neutrinos on a heavy water target. This opened up both the charged-current channel, open to electron neutrinos only, and also the neutral-current interaction, which occurs equally for all flavours of neutrino. SNO was thus able to measure both the pure electron-neutrino flux from the Sun as well as the total flux of all neutrino flavours, thus demonstrating that the theoretically predicted flux of electron neutrinos from the Sun was in fact oscillating to other flavours en route to the Earth. SNO+ will exchange the heavy water target for a scintillator target, with much higher light yield, allowing us to push much lower in energy. The primary goal of SNO+ is a search for neutrinoless double beta decay, a process which only occurs if the neutrino is in fact a Majorana particle: meaning it is its own antiparticle. This would make the neutrino unique among known particles, and could explain fundamental mysteries of the universe such as the known asymmetry between matter and antimatter. In addition SNO+ will have a board solar neutrino programme, using the Sun to study neutrinos and, at the same time, using neutrinos to study the Sun. We intend to make the first direct measurement of both pep and CNO neutrinos and, potentially, the very low-energy pp neutrinos themselves. This could enable us to resolve many unanswered questions both in the properties and behaviour of neutrinos, and also in the composition of the Sun itself. SNO+ will also be sensitive to reactor neutrino, geoneutrinos, and potential supernova neutrinos. I am also involved in the DEAP/CLEAN dark matter programme. This is a single-phase liquid noble gas approach to dark matter detection, intending to observe WIMP interactions by looking for the signature of the resultant nuclear recoil. MiniCLEAN, a 100-kg prototype, is currently under construction in the SNOLAB facility in Canada. The ultimate goal of this programme is the 50-ton-scale CLEAN experiment, with interchangeable liquid neon and argon targets, which would allow for both an unprecedented sensitivity to potential WIMP interactions, but also a percent-level precision in observations of the solar pp-neutrino flux.\",\n",

Research focuses largely on how noncoding regions of the genome function to control the differential patterns of gene expression, both spatial and temporal, that define cell behavior. The developmental stage of multicellular organisms in particular requires very explicit control of gene expression in order to layout different cell tissue types. Using model developmental systems, including the early Drosophila embyro, the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis , and the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum , we are working to develop a deeper understanding of genetic regulatory codes. Current Projects Whole genome CHiP-chip analysis of the RNA polymerase II DNA binding in the early Drosophila embryo revealed that many of the spatially patterned regulatory genes load polymerase to the promoter and initiate transcription independent of enhancer activity. Enhancer loading by the appropriate activating factors is required for transcription to proceed past promoter-proximal region, but not polymerase binding. We are investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in this form of regulation and its biological consequences for gene regulation. Similar CHiP-chip experiments for the primary Dorsal-ventral patterning transcription factors, Dorsal, Twist and Snail revealed novel DV enhancer elements. From these experiments, we have been able to show that some genes have multiple enhancers--secondary “shadow enhancers” located in more distal regions which drive the same pattern as the originally discovered primary enhancers. We are investigating the evolutionary context of these multiple enhancers by probing how they change across different Drosophilid and other insect species. We are also investigating the possible functional roles of these duplicate elements in the control of developmental patterning. One of the most amazing properties of developmental patterning systems is their reliability and robustness to perturbation. Despite the stochastic nature of the underlying reactions that control development, the whole process exhibits precise spatial regulation on the level of single cells separated by mere microns and surprising temporal coordination. We have developed quantitative population based assays to measure natural variability in the temporal and spatial expression patterns of individual genes, between cells in the same embryo and between different embryos of the same age. With this methods we have recently shown that genes which regulate the initiation step of transcription are activated in a much more stochastic fashion than the elongation regulated genes. We are adapting these methods to gain new insights into the reliability and robustness of Drosophila embryonic patterning. As simple chordates, sea squirts are the invertebrates most closely\\r\\n\\r\\nrelated to vertebrates. The genome of the sea squirt Ciona\\r\\n\\r\\nintestinalis has been sequenced and assembled and represents a\\r\\n\\r\\nsimplified version of vertebrate genomes. The Ciona tadpole is\\r\\n\\r\\ninitially composed of just ~1,000 cells and there is complete lineage\\r\\n\\r\\ninformation. It is possible to introduce transgenic DNAs into\\r\\n\\r\\nthousands of developing embryos at once using simple electroporation\\r\\n\\r\\nmethods. A provisional circuit diagram is now available for the\\r\\n\\r\\nspecification of the major larval tissues during embryogenesis.  This\\r\\n\\r\\ndiagram provides a foundation for understanding the differentiation of\\r\\n\\r\\nkey organs such as the notochord, central nervous system, and heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now using a combination of confocal imaging, cell sorting, and\\r\\n\\r\\nmicroarray assays to identify the genes and gene interactions\\r\\n\\r\\nresponsible for specification, morphogenesis, and differentiation in\\r\\n\\r\\nthese tissues. For instance, using these techniques we found that the\\r\\n\\r\\ntranscription factor FoxF directly activates a key rate-limiting\\r\\n\\r\\neffector of protrusive activity in migrating heart precursors. We are also interested in investigating how vertebrates could have\\r\\n\\r\\nevolved from a protochordate ancestor like the sea squirt. We have\\r\\n\\r\\nrecently shown that vertebrates and sea squirts are unique in that\\r\\n\\r\\nthey both possess facial muscles that share a common lineage with the\\r\\n\\r\\nheart. In sea squirts, this cardiopharyngeal mesoderm gives rise to\\r\\n\\r\\nthe beating heart as well as siphon muscles. In vertebrates, some of\\r\\n\\r\\nthe precursors that split away from the heart to form lower jaw\\r\\n\\r\\nmuscles actually contribute to the heart at a later stage- they form\\r\\n\\r\\nthe so-called Second Heart Field (SHF). On the basis of these\\r\\n\\r\\nsimilarities and differences, we propose a pre-vertebrate origin for\\r\\n\\r\\nthe jaw muscles and SHF of vertebrates. We believe the SHF arose from\\r\\n\\r\\ncooption of jaw muscle precursors back towards the heart. This\\r\\n\\r\\nincreased contribution would have allowed for the elaboration of the\\r\\n\\r\\nvertebrate heart relative to its sea squirt counterpart. There are\\r\\n\\r\\nmany other examples of vertebrate structures and cell types that\\r\\n\\r\\nlikely owe their origin to a pre-existing structure in the\\r\\n\\r\\nprotochordate ancestor, and we are in the process of uncovering these\\r\\n\\r\\nhidden connections and their underlying molecular mechanisms.

We are interested in identifiying the genes that control plant architecture and determining their mechanism of action. Plant architecture results from activities of meristems, thus our lab has a strong focus on the regulation of meristem activity. We characterize mutants that are affected in vegetative and/or inflorescence shoot meristems. The genes are identified through positional cloning and studied using a battery of molecular techniques. Maize is our model organism, but we often study a gene or trait in other grasses such as Brachypodium and Setaria . The laboratory research falls into three categories: 1) understanding the role and regulation of knotted1-like (knox) homeodomain transcription factors, 2) identifying genes that regulate inflorescence architecture in maize and the impacts of drought on inflorescence meristems, 3) determining the cellular signaling mechanisms that pattern a maize leaf. Educational Background: Ph.D.Plant BiologyWashington University, St. Louis, 1980 B.A.BiologyGrinnell College, 1975 Research The role of knox genes in maize and other species Knotted1-like homeobox (knox) genes are expressed in meristems and are specifically down-regulated as leaf primordia initiate. Dominant mutants exist in maize that misexpress knox genes in leaves, leading to striking proximal-distal defects. Recessive knox mutants in maize, rice and Arabidopsis fail to elaborate a shoot, thus revealing a function for knox genes in the meristem. We have identified the targets of KNOTTED1 in maize and are carrying out similar experiments in rice and sorghum. Most of the hormone pathways are regulated by KN1. The present goal is to determine which targets are most critical in the meristem and which targets are involved in the leaf patterning defect. We are also seeking to understand the chromatin context of KN1 regulation. A dominant Knotted1 mutant that results from a transposon insertion in the intron. The normally smooth leaves have bumps (knots) that result from blade cells adopting sheath fate. Inflorescence architecture in maize and other grasses Nearly all grasses are characterized by the spikelet, a short branch that contains floral meristems. The diversity in the grasses reflects variation in the organization of spikelets that ultimately originates from activities of meristems. With NSF support, we identified many of the genes that regulate inflorescence architecture in maize. These genes are defined by their mutant phenotypes. Our goal now is to ask how drought affects expression of these master regulatory genes and to identify genes that are responsible for the natural diversity in maize inflorescence architecture. A scanning electron micrograph of an ear primordia showing rows of spikelet meristems, each of which will develop into a kernel. Positional signaling in maize leaf development The maize leaf offers a unique opportunity to study how cells respond to their position and differentiate accordingly. The proximal part of the maize leaf is the sheath, a tissue that wraps around the culm. The distal part of the leaf is the blade, which lays flat to optimize photosynthesis. At the junction of the sheath and blade is the ligule region. In addition to this major proximal-distal axis, the abaxial-adaxial and medial-lateral axes are also defined by distinct cell types and tissue organization. How these axes are established and coordinated is not known. We are using maize mutants to identify the genes that regulate this coordinate system.

       " 'Coye Cheshire': 'Coye Cheshire Associate Professor Focus Social exchange, social psychology, social networks and information exchange Research areas Computer-mediated Communication Data Science Social & Cultural Studies Biography Professor Cheshire is Associate Professor at the UC Berkeley School of Information. He studies social exchange, cooperation, trust, and interpersonal relationships in computer-mediated environments. He received his Ph.D. in sociology from Stanford University, and M.A. and B.A. in sociology from Stanford University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, respectively. Computer-mediated environments often prevent us from using the social cues that we rely on in other forms of offline social interaction. As a result, online social interactions provide a unique and fascinating setting for studying social phenomena in the presence of socio-technical constraints and affordances. Professor Cheshire is a technology advocate and information technology enthusiast, so his attraction to sociology, social psychology, the Internet, new media, and computer-mediated communication became a natural blend of his personal and professional pursuits. Current Research I am interested in the social aspects of computer networks and information exchange systems, including risk, uncertainty, trust, and cooperation.My current research projects include a series of lab experiments examining shifts in modes of social exchange (in the US and across societies), a longitudinal study of Wikipedia editors and their motivations for contributing effort over time, a longitudinal study of online romantic relationships, and the application of social psychological selective incentives to different Internet collective action problems. I strongly believe in using different (and sometimes mixed) methodological approaches to address complex research problems, including laboratory and field experiments, longitudinal and cross-sectional survey analysis, online behavioral log analysis, and in-depth qualitative interviews.

Her current book project, The Public Competency Crisis, explores the micro-politics of privatization, assessing the ways that citizens understand and form preferences toward public versus private provision of goods and services. Professor Lerman’s scholarship can be found in a variety of journals, including the American Political Science Review, Perspectives on Politics, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and Punishment and Society. She received her PhD in 2008 from the University of California, Berkeley.

The Modern Prison Paradox: Politics, Punishment, and SocialCommunity Lerman, Amy E . The Modern Prison Paradox: Politics, Punishment, and Social Community . Cambridge UP,2013. Abstract In The Modern Prison Paradox, Amy E. Lerman examines the shift from rehabilitation to punitivism that has taken place in the politics and practice of American corrections. She argues that this punitive turn has had profoundly negative consequences for both crime control and American community life. Professor Lerman's research shows that spending time in America's increasingly violent and castigatory prisons strengthens inmates' criminal networks and fosters attitudes that increase the likelihood of criminal activity following parole. Additionally, Professor Lerman assesses whether America's more punitive prisons similarly shape the social attitudes and behaviors of correctional staff. Her analysis reveals that working in more punitive prisons causes correctional officers to develop an “us against them” mentality while on the job, and that the stress and wariness officers acquire at work carries over into their personal lives, straining relationships with partners, children, and friends.

Bloom PhD Professor of the Graduate School, Health Policy and Management Education: PhD - Sociology of Education, Stanford University MA - Sociology, Stanford University BS - University of California, Berkeley Courses: Health Organizations and Management Advanced Health Care Organizations and Environment Health and Medical Care Research Interests: Late effects of treatment on cancer survivors Effects of exercise and diet on late effects of cancer treatment Implementing and sustaining change in health organizations Reducing cancer disparities in Alameda County Research Description: I am interested in the prevention, early detection, and long term effects of chronic disease and its treatment on one's quality of life defined broadly to include the physical, social, psychological and spiritual well-being. I have a special interest in designing and testing interventions to reduce the effects of chronic disease and its treatment. Within this broad area, I am interested in one's response to being at greater than average risk due to one's family history. I have also had an interest in disparities in health outcomes due to age and ethnicity. A second interest has focused on the organizations in which health care is delivered and the effectiveness of new programs that are implemented such as changes in the financing and the delivery of care. Current Projects: I am currently completing a ten year follow-up of young women with breast cancer to assess their quality of life compared to their quality of life at five years post-diagnosis and to a cancer-free comparison group. A second project focuses on the effectiveness of an exercise program taking place in YMCAs in the SF Greater Bay Area to reduce the long-term effects of treatment on young women with breast cancer. A third project focuses on outreach, community based participatory research, and training to reduce cancer disparities in Alameda County using religious organizations and community clinics to deliver education, prevention and early detection programs. Other smaller projects fall within these three areas. Selected Publications: Fernandes-Taylor S., Bloom JR .

Education Ph.D. Human Geography, University of Washington–Seattle MA Human Geography, University of Washington–Seattle BA, Stanford University Biography Carolina Reid is an Assistant Professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning and the Faculty Research Advisor for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation. Carolina specializes in housing and community development, with a specific focus on access to credit, homeownership and wealth inequality. She has most recently published research on the impact of the foreclosure crisis on low-income and minority communities, the role of the Community Reinvestment Act during the subprime crisis, and the importance of anti-predatory lending laws for consumer protection. Carolina is particularly interested in interdisciplinary research and the integration of qualitative and quantitative methods. Carolina brings nearly two decades of applied work experience to her research and teaching. Before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley, Carolina worked for a year at the Center for Responsible Lending, where she undertook policy analyses on how provisions in Dodd-Frank could affect future access to credit for lower-income and minority households. Before that, Carolina served as the Research Manager for the Community Development Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for six years. At the SF Fed, Carolina published numerous journal and policy articles on topics related to housing and community development, and helped to build the capacity of local stakeholders — including banks, nonprofits, and local governments — to undertake community development activities, especially in the areas of affordable housing, early childcare education, asset building, and neighborhood revitalization. Carolina has also held positions with the World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C., where she worked on urban environmental issues and the environmental impacts on health; the Environmental Health and Social Policy Center in Seattle, where she contributed to the evaluation of Jobs-Plus, a welfare-to-work demonstration targeted to residents living in public housing developments; and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment based out of Penang, Malaysia, where she managed an effort to understand how indigenous knowledge about environmental change could be integrated into international environmental decision-making processes.

       " 'Stephan Lammel': 'Stephan Lammel Contact Info Assistant Professor of Neurobiology Lab Homepage: http://www.lammellab.org/ Full Directory Information Research Interests The World Health Organization estimates that mental, neurological and substance use disorders account for 13% of the global burden of disease, and one in four people will develop one or more disabling mental disorders during their lifetime. Depression alone accounts for 4.3% of the global burden of disease and is among the largest single cause of disability worldwide. Many drugs currently used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders are highly unselective, in some cases affecting multiple neurotransmitter systems in many different brain regions, which can result in severe unwanted side effects. Nevertheless, the drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric diseases have changed little over the last 40 years, largely because we do not yet understand how the neural circuits altered by these diseases operate in the healthy brain, let alone how they malfunction in disease. Recently, several technical advances have afforded the opportunity to more thoroughly understand circuit function. Specifically, the combination of optogenetics, electrophysiology and novel viral tracing techniques has revolutionized modern neuroscience and will provide new opportunities for mapping and functional testing of brain circuits. Our laboratory employs these techniques with the goal to provide an essential foundation for understanding normal and pathological brain function. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have received significant attention because of their importance in reward-based behaviors and evidence of their perturbation in neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, depression and schizophrenia. These VTA dopamine neurons were thought to represent a homogeneous cell population, the identification of which was based on a controversial set of criteria in vivo and ex vivo . However, a much greater diversity of dopamine cell type and function has been demonstrated recently. A major goal of our lab is to elucidate the organization and functions of midbrain dopamine circuits, as well as the pathological changes that occur in these circuits as a consequence of disease using a multidisciplinary approach combining electrophysiology, optogenetics and behavioral assays as well as neural circuit tracing. Investigating dopamine midbrain neurons as heterogeneous circuit elements may be the key to understanding causes of pathological conditions that are associated with these cells including substance abuse disorders and depression as well as novel therapeutic approaches to treat these afflictions.

Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley B.S., University of California, Santa Barbara Philosophy Statement What makes a building memorable? I believe it comes not from the glossy images in a magazine, but from the experiences of people who live, work, or pass through the interior spaces. The environmental forces of sun, wind and light have a strong influence on a building's experiential aesthetic, and the consideration of these forces should be a purposeful part of the earliest stages of design. I guide students to learn about principles, tools, and values that will enhance their ability to create buildings that are both beautiful and efficient, responsive to climate and people, sensitive to the environment, and a delight to be in. Biography Gail Brager, Ph.D., has been a Professor in the Building Science & Sustainability area of the Department since 1984, and is also an Affiliate Faculty member of the Energy and Resources Group. Prof. Brager serves as the Associate Director of the Center for the Built Environment, a research collaboration between the University and over 40 industry partners focused on improving the energy performance and environmental quality in buildings, with a focus on the workplace. This collaboration is important for making connections between research and the design and manufacturing industries. Prof. Brager conducts research and teaching across multiple dimensions of sustainability addressing the design, operation, and assessment of buildings, with a focus on thermal comfort and adaptation, occupant well-being, natural ventilation, and personalized environmental control.

Her work investigates viral and host factors that modulate disease severity and immune correlates of protection and pathogenesis, using in vitro approaches, animal models, and research involving human populations. In vitro studies have focused on functional characterization of antibodies and B cell memory response, virus-host interactions and viral pathogenesis, viral fitness and evolution, and the mechanism of viral translation and replication. The mouse models developed by her group recapitulate many aspects of human dengue disease and immune response, including antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, and are being used to identify antibody determinants of protection, enhancement, and therapeutic efficacy. Her international work focuses on laboratory-based and epidemiological studies of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and influenza in endemic Latin American countries, particularly in Nicaragua, where she has been working closely with the Ministry of Health for over 28 years. Long-term collaborations include clinical, biological, and immunological studies of severe disease through an 18-year pediatric hospital-based study; a 13-year pediatric cohort study of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and influenza transmission in Managua; and a recently concluded cluster randomized controlled trial of evidence-based community-derived interventions to prevent and control arboviral diseases.

The Solar Energy Materials Research Group is led by Senior Scientist Wladek Walukiewicz (PI) and Kin Man Yu (co-PI). Senior Staff Scientist Zuzanna Liliental-Weber is also associated with the program. The group is developing novel materials that address the immediate need for sustainable, clean energy sources. We are currently investigating Group III-Nitride semiconductors and highly-mismatched alloys for a number of energy-generating applications. Moreover, we are also developing transparent conductors for full spectrum solar cell applications. The following are a few examples: Full-spectrum Solar Cell The newly discovered narrow bandgap of InN Eg~0.7 has extended the spectral range of the InGaN alloy system into the infrared region. That makes InGaN an excellent material for high-efficiency multi-junction (tandem) solar cells. As shown in the picture below, the bandgap of the InGaN alloy matches the solar spectrum (Air Mass 1.5) almost perfectly [1]... more >> InGaN-Si hybrid tandem cell No\\ntunnel junction needed Built\\non well-established Si solar cell technology \"Multiband\" Solar Cell The intermediate band acts as a “stepping stone,” allowing absorption of photons at three different energy levels, corresponding to the three different band gaps. In particular, low-energy photons are captured that would pass through a conventional solar cell... more >> An\\nintermediate band solar cell using dilute GaNAs (~2% N) HMA demonstrates an\\noptical activity of three energy bands that absorb and convert into electrical\\ncurrent the crucial part of the solar spectrum. The\\nnarrow intermediate band acts only as a “stepping stone” enabling efficient use\\nof low energy solar photons Highly Mismatched Alloys Highly mismatched alloys (HMAs ) is a new class of semiconductors formed through alloying of distinctly\\ndifferent materials. HMAs have the\\nelectronic band structure drastically different from that of the component\\nmaterials, offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling the band gap and\\nthe location of the conduction and valence\\nband edges. Ideal Transparent Conductor for Full Spectrum PV Strong\\nabsorption and reflection by high concentration free carrier gas is responsible\\nfor low transparency of standard transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) in the\\ninfrared (IR) region ( l >1000 nm) and restricts the\\napplications of these materials to photovoltaics that do not utilize the IR part of the\\nsolar spectrum. Maintaining low\\nresistivity and low free carrier absorption requires TCOs with the highest\\npossible charge carrier mobility. Recently\\nwe have developed high mobility CdO based transparent conducting\\noxides (TCOs) with exceptionally high conductivity (>10 4 S/cm) and transmission window in\\nthe wavelength range from 400 to >1500 nm making this material an ideal\\nTCO for photovoltaics with low band gap absorbers.

Lightfoot is Professor of Anthropology and Class of 1960 Chair in Undergraduate Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Trained in the field of North American archaeology, he specializes in the study of late pre-colonial people and their subsequent encounters with diverse European colonial regimes. After receiving his B.A. in Anthropology from Stanford University (1975), and his Ph.D. in Anthropology from Arizona State University (1981), he taught at Northern Illinois University (1982) and the SUNY at Stony Brook (1982-1987), before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley in 1987. He currently serves as the Curator of North American Archaeology in the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology and as a Faculty Associate of the Archaeological Research Facility on the Berkeley campus. Lightfoot has directed archaeological projects in New England, the American Southwest, and along the Pacific Coast of North America. In the last ten years he has focused his studies on the impressive shell mounds of the greater San Francisco Bay, the Russian colony of Fort Ross (1812-1843) and nearby historic Spanish missions in northern California, and landscape management practices employed by complex hunter-hunters in central California. These collaborative research programs, involving local tribes, state and national parks, and students and faculty from a diverse range of fields, have been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, and the Joint Fire Science Program. The inter-disciplinary nature of this work has been facilitated by the Berkeley Initiative in Global Change Biology at UC Berkeley. Lightfoot and his collaborators have published their work in a series of book chapters and journal articles, including a special issue of California Archaeology (2013). Lightfoot’s recent books include Indians, Missionaries, and Merchants: The Legacy of Colonial Encounters on the California Frontiers (2005, UC Press) and California Indians and their Environments: An Introduction (with Otis Parrish) (2009, UC Press). During his tenure as a Guggenheim Fellow (2014-2015) and Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) at Stanford University (2014-2015), Lightfoot worked on a new theoretical perspective for understanding complex hunter-gatherers in California that synthesizes a wealth of recent information about their sophisticated management practices designed to enhance the biodiversity and sustainability of biotic communities. He is currently exploring how these strategies of diversification may have differed fundamentally from other Native American populations involved primarily in agrarian production. In collaboration with members of his research team, he is evaluating how these indigenous enhancement practices may provide new insights for policies and practices currently employed in the management of open spaces and wild lands in California. Lightfoot is currently involved in archaeological research at Fort Ross State Historic Park, Point Reyes National Seashore, and the Santa Cruz Coast, as well as studying museum collections in the Phoebe A.

       " 'Cihan Ziya Tugal': 'Associate Professor Research Interests: Political sociology, social movements, religion, Islam and the Middle East, culture, poverty and class, social theory, ethnography. Office: 448 Barrows Profile: Cihan Tuğal works on mobilization, socioeconomic change, and the role of religion in sociopolitical projects. His publications so far fall in four major clusters: ethnographic study of Islamic mobilization in Turkey; comparative study of Islamisms across the Middle East; revolt and revolution in the contemporary world system; ethnographic and historical research on Christian and Islamic charity. His book Passive Revolution: Absorbing the Islamic Challenge to Capitalism was published in 2009 by Stanford University Press. Tuğal\\'s first book, as well as a couple of his articles, is based on a two-phase ethnography of a poor and conservative district in Istanbul. He has taught in this district, and participated in its religious and political life. Situating the ethnography within the development of capitalism in Turkey, he demonstrates how Islamic movements have mobilized the poor and marginal intellectuals to later integrate them to secular, market-oriented politics. This is a process of passive revolution, whereby previously oppositional networks are absorbed into existing power structures. Tuğal nowstudies Islamic mobilization in Egypt and Iran, in order to understand why similar movements have not resulted in a comparable Islamic market consensus in these countries. He argues that Islamic politics has interacted with civil society and the state in different ways in these three cases, leading to the victory of neoliberalized Islam in Turkey, its defeat in Iran, and a stalemate in Egypt (up until 2013). His collaborative work with de Leon and Desai (2009; 2015) has emphasized that political parties are central to the making of these differences. The revolutionary situation in the Middle East presents new possibilities for neoliberal Islam, as well as new impediments to its popularization, as pointed out in Tuğal’sarticle in Development and Change . His 2012 article in New Left Review , however, hints that the same situation has paradoxically dynamited the prospects for further Islamic liberalization within Turkey. This comparative work has culminated in Tuğal’s second major book ( The Fall of the Turkish Model: How the Arab Uprisings Brought Down Islamic Liberalism ), published by Verso in 2016. The book demonstrates how Turkey\\'s interactions with corporatist and communitarian Islamisms throughout the Middle East (as well as political economic dynamics) ultimately spelled the end of the Islamic liberal era (both in Turkey and in the region as a whole). Tuğal’s 2013 article in New Perspectives on Turkey points out that world-systemic dynamics have incited sustained mobilization not only in the Middle East, but elsewhere as well. Despite many regional and national differences, marketization and financialization (as well as decreasing American military-diplomatic effectiveness) have initiated a new era of protest. The heavy presence of middle strata in these protests puts a contradictory ideological and aesthetic stamp on today’s mass politics.Tuğal’s most recent article in Thesis Eleven traces these contradictions through comparisons of American, Turkish, Tunisian, and Egyptian cases. Tuğal’s other ongoing project focuses on Islamic and Christian charity, both historically and ethnographically. He traces how charitable giving has mutated over the centuries to bolster the making of the liberal subject. This transformation of charity is still open to (mostly weak) challenges, as his Polanyi-inspiredarticle in Qualitative Sociology demonstrates. His article in Rethinking Marxism problematizes both caritas (Christian love and charity) and its Marxist dismissal. Another forthcoming article studies fields of charity in Egypt and Turkey based on a Bourdieusian critique of institutionalist theory. His work in progress explores whether charitable practices can foster alternative subjectivities anywhere in the Christian or Muslim world.Tuğal’s next book will synthesize these Polanyian, Marxian, Bourdieusian, and Foucaultian strands of his research to present more conclusive statements on charity.

       " 'David Meyer': 'David  Meyer Adjunct Professor of Landscape Architecture & Environmental Planning Philosophy Statement My goal as a practicing landscape architect has always been to create and build landscapes that transcend – that honor the inherent qualities of a site – and anchor themselves in the hearts and minds of the people who experience them. There is always something inherent to a place that wants to be expressed, augmented and validated. But a great idea or a unique design isn’t enough. In my long career, I have become increasingly emphatic about execution. For me, physicality rules. I incorporate the discipline of a professional practice in all my studios and challenge students from both a conceptual and practical standpoint. My lectures and my crits are theory-based but I insist on a level of inquiry and rigor that leads students to think more critically about everything they do, whether it’s expressing an idea or choosing a material. And yes, I make people draw. No matter their ultimate goal, I sincerely believe that students leave the semester energized by a greater awareness of their aesthetic and a much stronger appreciation for how to transform ideas into the physical realm. Biography In his 30-year career as a licensed landscape architect, David Meyer has directed the design and execution of prestigious, award-winning projects throughout the world. Before co-founding Meyer + Silberberg - Land Architects with Ramsey Silberberg, David was a partner at Peter Walker & Partners and co-founded Schwartz Smith Meyer with Martha Schwartz and Ken Smith. Now in it’s tenth year, Meyer + Silberberg is recognized for its artistry, technical expertise and, above all, the strength of its designs. David grew up in agrarian Iowa, in a sensual landscape characterized by change and geometry. The emotional connection he has with that context has greatly influenced his aesthetic and his designs, which are simple, deliberate marks on the land that arise from the realities of the place imposed by man and nature. While David has taught at UC Berkeley for the past 16 years, he is, above all, a practitioner. His recent projects include the master plan restoration for historic Foothill College, the ecologically grounded master plan for Langfang, China that won an AIA urban design award and Parc Dounya, a 1000-acre park in Algeria. Work recently built, or under construction, includes Lake Dianshan’s North Shore, a 300-acre waterfront park along Shanghai’s largest source of potable water, Fibrogen Headquarters in San Francisco, the hip new courtyard at Airbnb\\'s new headquarters in San Francisco and a patient and visitor garden for Richard Meier’s new building at the Jules Stein Eye Institute on the UCLA Campus. A Fellow of the American Academy in Rome (2001) and on the peer review board for the GSA design excellence program, David has received numerous awards and honors. The firm’s work has been featured in the New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, London Sunday Times, Competitions, Landscape Architecture and on the covers of Studies in the History of Gardens & Designed Landscapes International Quarterly and the American Academy in Rome’s Society of Fellows Magazine. His work is also featured in Alan Tate’s Great City Parks and in Tim Richardson’s Avant Gardeners.

       " 'Iryna Dronova': \"Iryna  Dronova Assistant Professor of Landscape Architecture & Environmental Planning Education PhD, University of California Berkeley, 2012 MS, University of Michigan 2004 Philosophy Statement I am interested in diverse aspects of landscape ecology and its potential to inform sustainable, multi-functional landscape-designs, and decision-making in environmental planning. My research combines field ecological methods with remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis to perform analyses of multi-scale structure of ecosystems, to facilitate scaling of ecological processes from local to regional levels and to develop remote sensing-based monitoring approaches for vulnerable areas and sites with limited field access. My current research focuses on the following principal themes: 1) Dynamics of wetland vegetation and ecosystem services in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta). Both in the Delta and globally, emergent wetland plants control important ecosystem processes (e.g., aboveground productivity, greenhouse gas fluxes and subsidence-counteracting belowground peat storage), habitat for birds and other wildlife and recreational, aesthetic and cultural values to humans. Changing climate, increasing demands for water, alien species invasions and other pressures create urgent needs to better understand multi-functionality of wetland canopies and their response to change drivers in order to develop sustainable management and planning strategies for the multi-functional Delta landscape. In our group we are taking advantage of the rich remote sensing and geospatial data libraries and diversity of wetland field sites in the region to interpolate important biophysical characteristics of wetland canopies such as leaf area index and better understand their response to climate, hydrology and recent land use history. 2) Effects of city environment on urban ecosystem services . It is well known that urbanization affects landscape carbon and energy balance by reducing green plant cover while creating more fertilized environments for remaining and new vegetation, and by increasing impervious surface and forming strong thermal gradients within city areas. However, much uncertainty still exists on how the relationships between physical properties of urban environments and ecological function of urban vegetation change over time with the dynamics of urban landscapes, and how they vary across different metropolitan areas of the world. Combining time series of satellite remote sensing with ground-based data on urban ecosystem structure is a promising venue to investigate these complex feedbacks and links between broad-scale urban structure and ecological services of specific sites and their designs. 3) Coupled thermal-vegetation patterns as indicators of development and socioeconomic context in urban regions. Among various benefits of urban vegetation, local cooling and improvement of thermal comfort are especially well-known in light of elevated heat loads in built-up environments. What is not well understood, however, is how these benefits vary with different urban morphologies and socioeconomic contexts of development. Using repeatedly collected optical and thermal satellite imagery, we can characterize spatial patterns of green vegetation cover and surface temperature proxies and develop the indicators of urban environment that may elucidate the character and broader context of development. Such indicators are especially needed in data-scarce regions and locations where the outcomes of development create substantial risks to human well-being and vulnerability to climate change and hazards. Biography I have completed a PhD in Environmental Science, Policy & Management at UC Berkeley in 2012, a M.S. degree in Natural Resources/Terrestrial Ecology & Management and a Certificate in Spatial Analysis from the School of Natural Resource and Environment at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2004 and a B.S. degree in Ecology from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Ukraine in 2001. My previous research included applications of vegetation and landscape ecology, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to study ecosystem properties and change in grasslands of Ukraine, transitioning forests of northern Michigan, USA, large wetland biodiversity hotspots in PR China and California, USA. My current research focuses predominantly on wetland systems and urbanizing landscapes in California and globally.

       " 'Ann Swidler': 'Professor Research Interests: Culture, religion, theory, institutionalization, African responses to HIV/AIDS Office: 444 Barrows Curriculum Vitae: Ann\\'s VITA.pdf Profile: Ann Swidler (PhD UC Berkeley; BA Harvard) studies the interplay of culture and institutions. She asks how culture works–both how people use it and how it shapes social life. She is best known for her books Talk of Love, and the co-authored works Habits of the Heart and The Good Society, as well as her classic article, “Culture in Action: Symbols and Strategies” (American Sociological Review, 1986). Her most recent book, Talk of Love: How Culture Matters (Chicago, 2001), examines how actors select among elements of their cultural repertoires and how culture gets organized “from the outside in” by Codes, Contexts, and Institutions. In the co-authored Habits of the Heart and The Good Society, she and her collaborators analyzed the consequences of American individualism for individual selfhood, community, and political and economic institutions. With colleagues from the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, she has been engaged in an ambitious project to understand the societal determinants of human health and well being. Swidler’s current research is on cultural and institutional responses to the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Swidler’s research on AIDS Africa has led both to work on NGOs and the international response to the epidemic and to work on transactional sex, cultural barriers to condom use, and factors that have made the responses to the epidemic more successful in some African countries than in others. She is interested in how the massive international AIDS effort in sub-Saharan Africa–the infusion of money, organizations, programs and projects–interacts with existing cultural and institutional patterns to create new dilemmas and new possibilities. She is exploring these issues from two directions: From the international side, she examines how the international AIDS effort is structured (who provides money to whom, how collaborative networks are structured, how programs get organized on the ground); why some interventions are favored over others; and what organizational forms international funders opt for. From the African side, she is exploring why the NGO sector is more robust in some countries than others; when international AIDS efforts stimulate vs. impede or derail local efforts; and what organizational syncretisms sometimes emerge. Swidler\\'s most recent work examines African religion and the institutions of African chieftaincy in order to understand the cultural and religious sources of collective capacities for social action. Professor Swidler teaches sociology of culture, sociology of religion, and sociological theory. Her interests increasingly touch on political sociology, development, and sociology of science and medicine as well.

       " 'Daphne Edwards': 'Daphne  Edwards Lecturer in Landscape Architecture & Environmental Planning Specializations Xeriscape planting (native Californian and Mediterranean plants), urban agriculture. Education Master of Landscape Architecture, UC Berkeley BA, Stanford University Philosophy Statement Genius loci is the spirit that pervades a space, the arrangement of elements that makes it what it is. Similarly, every student who comes to study design at Berkeley possesses elements of human genius: intuition, perception, courage, imagination. Many students enter the department with strong analytical and graphic abilities, and these, along with invention, are the skills that our program develops so well. But every landscape student I’ve ever met comes to the profession with one other thing: a deep belief in the power of beauty. Ironically, formal training can frighten this belief away. This can be seen in built environments all around us, even those projects recognized for creative technical solutions to landscape problems. As an instructor, my job is not just to equip students with the analytical and visual design tools they need to convey their ideas with conviction. Passing on these skills is a joy, but I know that my most important role as a mentor and practitioner is to bring attention back to beauty. Without reverence for the innate genius of place and of one’s own humanity, good design is simply not possible — not with all the imagination and technical proficiency in the world. Biography Daphne Edwards created her landscape design studio, Daphne Edwards Landscape Architecture, in 2010, after 7 years with Berkeley-based Peter Walker Partners, where she worked on projects ranging from the World Trade Center Memorial in NYC to a redesign of the campus at the University of Texas at Austin. She now focuses on residential projects in the greater San Francisco Bay Area with strong emphasis on ecological sustainability, food production, and landscapes with sculpture collections. She believes in the transformative power of good design, and holds that beauty itself plays as strong a role as ecology in the sustainability of designed landscapes.

       " 'Joel Moore': 'Research Area(s): Condensed Matter Physics And Materials Science Biography Joel Moore joined the physics department faculty as an assistant professor in January 2002. He received his A.B. summa cum laude in physics from Princeton University in 1995 and spent a Fulbright year at TIFR before graduate studies at MIT on a Hertz fellowship. After completing his Ph.D. in 2000, he worked at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at UCSB and in theoretical physics research at Bell Labs before coming to Berkeley. He is currently a Simons Investigator, an elected Fellow and Member-at-Large of the American Physical Society, and an officer of the Aspen Center for Physics. Research Interests I am a theoretical physicist studying condensed matter. My main interest is in the properties of “strongly correlated” materials and devices, in which electron-electron interactions yield new states of matter. The zero-temperature phase transitions between correlated quantum states are an especially beautiful and universal part of this field. Another currently exciting area is understanding how correlated quantum states transport charge, spin, and heat: aside from fundamental interest, this can lead to new devices for spin-based electronics and new thermoelectric materials. We also use concepts from quantum information theory to analyze problems in condensed matter physics. Theoretical work on these problems benefits from an increasing quantity and quality of experimental data, and students in the group are encouraged to interact with experimental efforts at Berkeley and elsewhere. Current Projects Quantum phase transitions : One current research topic is the theory of disorder-driven quantum phase transitions, such as superconductor-insulator and Hall transitions: these show universal scaling laws but are not nearly as well understood as their classical analogues. There is a highly successful theory of classical phase transitions which also describes a few quantum phase transitions, but not those of the greatest experimental importance. There are several complex and poorly understood materials such as the cuprate superconductors and heavy-fermion compounds which seem experimentally to show quantum phase transitions. Although there is a shortage of nonperturbative methods in dimensions greater than one, some useful examples have appeared in the last few years. Interaction effects in nanoscale devices : The effects of electron-electron interactions become especially dramatic when electrons are confined in quantum dots (zero-dimensional systems), nanotubes or quantum wires (one-dimensional), or quantum wells (two-dimensional). Experimentalists are now creating a wide variety of tiny devices and in many cases accessing regimes where a weakly interacting description misses essential physics. In many such problems, a few localized quantum variables, such as a single spin or the electrons on a superconducting grain, interact with a “sea” of surrounding electrons or phonons which can fundamentally modify the dynamics of the localized degrees of freedom. As an example, in the Kondo effect an unpaired spin forms a correlated state with the surrounding electrons, and experimentalists can now observe and control this behavior in single atoms, molecular transistors, and quantum dots. Other topics in condensed matter theory : Although recently the above projects have taken up most of my time, there are many other areas in which similar analytical and computational techniques can be applied. Two of my physics “hobbies” are the physics of percolation and polymers, and applications of statistical physics to information theory and computing. Students are welcome to drop by and discuss specific problems in which they have an interest or condensed matter theory in general. Publications C. Xu and J. E.

Discotic Materials The performance of state-of-the-art molecular electronic devices based on organic materials depends to a significant extent on the precise control of the structure over multiple orders of magnitude. While the individual bonds between atoms largely dictate the arrangement on a molecular level, the intermolecular order in close proximity to a metal-organic interphase remains unpredictable. One of the principal challenges of our research lies in the development of new synthetic self-assembly strategies that allow us to translate the well-defined structural control of single molecules (nm scale) into large homogeneous domains (mm scale). In an effort to accomplish this goal we employ tools derived both from supramolecular chemistry, as well as lessons learned from the study of ligand-protein interactions. Graphene Nanoribbons The potential of single layer graphene based electronic devices has been recognized mostly due to its exceptionally high charge carrier mobility. While the extended two-dimensional hexagonal carbon lattice is a semimetal or a zero-gap semiconductor, structural confinement to an essentially one-dimensional graphene ribbon opens a band-gap large enough to expose room temperature semiconductor properties. The commercial application of single layer graphene nanoribbons in molecular electronics is largely limited by the low yield and the inherent inhomogeneity of the materials produced by synthetic methods based on exfoliation of highly pyrolitic graphite, unzipping of carbon nanotubes, or epitaxial growth on catalytic surfaces. The primary goal of our research is the development of a synthetic approach towards atomically defined graphene nanoribbons. Supramolecular Catalysts The functionalization of readily available prochiral olefins has been established as a robust and highly versatile method for the introduction of chirality in organic synthesis. Whereas modern catalysts can accurately direct the stereoselctive outcome of these reactions, the regioselectivity is largely subjected to the substrate reactivity, and its control remains the dominion of a small number of synthetically useful enzymes, which are mostly capable of catalyzing only the corresponding type of chemical reaction. The long-term goal of this project is the development of a regio- and stereoselective catalyst system based on a supramolecular receptor capable of activating selected double bonds in polyenes. The proposed research aims at the development of a catalyst system combining the regio- and stereoselectivity normally found in an enzyme-mediated reaction with the broad substrate scope and reaction types associated with modern catalysts.

We use a wide array of experimental organisms and interdisciplinary approaches to investigate fundamental questions about assembly, regulation, and dynamics of photosynthesis. Current lab members study the biosynthesis and function of photosynthetic pigments, assembly of photosynthetic reaction centers, structure and dynamics of the photosynthetic membrane, mechanisms involved in sensing excess light, and regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting in saturating light. By comparing how photosynthesis works in diverse organisms, we hope to uncover general design principles of natural photosynthesis as well as unique adaptations to different environments. Algal biology Eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria (often collectively referred to simply as “algae”) are relatively simple phototrophic organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis similar to that in land plants. Algae are amazingly diverse in terms of habitat, biochemistry, physiology, and morphology, and they have critical roles in global ecology and biogeochemistry. Aquatic microalgae (phytoplankton) are responsible for approximately half of the net primary production of organic matter on Earth, and they have recently re-emerged as potential next-generation feedstocks for biofuels ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/algae-fuel.html ).

       " 'Gary Firestone': \"Gary Firestone Contact Info Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/firestone/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Our overall goal is to characterize the cell signaling pathways that inhibit the uncontrolled growth of epithelial-derived tumor cells, the cell type of most human cancers and develop preclinical strategies that can potentially be used to design new anti-cancer therapeutics. Molecular, biochemical, cell biological and physiological experimental strategies are being utilized to explore the mechanisms by which extracellular signals (such as steroid hormones, growth factors and certain dietary and nondietary phytochemicals) coordinately regulate the proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration and cell-cell interactions of human cancer cells. We employ several distinct human cancer cell model systems that include hormone sensitive and insensitive breast cancer cells, prostate cancer cells, endometrial cancer cells, and human melanoma cells. In addition, we have been involved in a clinical collaboration, and we have recently established that certain human mammary epithelial cancer cells can be converted into a phenotype with stem cell-like properties that becomes highly sensitive to the apoptotic effects of dietary indoles. The breadth of the cancer research strategies in the Firestone lab spans the range from “promoter bashing” and intracelluar signaling to physiological approaches with animal tumor models and human clinical studies. Current Projects One major focus of our research is to investigate the anti-proliferative effects of phytochemicals in human reproductive cancer cells and human melanoma cells. We have uncovered the critical cellular pathways that are regulated by indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a compound produced in cruciferous Brassica plants such as broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts, and its natural dimerization product 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) that suppress the proliferation, induce apoptosis and disrupts steroid hormone and growth factor responsiveness of human cancer cells. Our studies have established the first molecular understanding of how these compounds target specific cell cycle components, the estrogen receptor, and the p53 tumor suppressor protein through the control of gene transcription, cell signaling components, and functional protein complexes. In addition, we have identified the enzyme elastase as the first I3C-specific target protein and that the I3C inhibition of elastase enzymatic activity disrupts cyclin E processing and CD40 processing, which together directly accounts for the loss of cell cycle control and disruption of NFkB cell survival responses. We have recently developed in silico computational modeling strategies to uncover predicted I3C interactions with elastase and have used this approach to predict new classes of I3C target proteins and to synthesize new I3C-related compounds with significantly enhanced efficacy for anti-cancer properties. We have also used human mammary preneoplastic epithelial cells to develop a novel cell line with a human breast cancer stem cell-like phenotype that we are using to understand how tumor stem cells can be controlled through I3C and its more potent derivatives. We have collaborated with clinicians and the Bjeldanes' laboratory (Dept. Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology) to complete the first clinical study in Marin County, CA of the I3C dimer DIM, to show that DIM alters urinary steroid metabolites of postmenopausal women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. For more information about DIM, please see the Diindolylmethane (DIM) Information Resource Center at http://www.diindolylmethane.org/ or the Diindolylmethane (DIM) Immune Activation Data Center found at http://www.activamune.com/diindolylmethane_dim_immune_activation_data_center.htm We have recently been investigating the anti-cancer properties and signaling pathways of other natural compounds such as the natural anti-malaria drug artemisinin, which is found in the sweet wormwood plant. Artemisinin induces a cell cycle arrest of both early stage and late stage human breast cancer cells and human prostate cancer cells through distinct mechanisms. We have established that artemisinin regulates the expression and/or activity of specific sets of transcription factors that selectively target cell cycle components, as well as hormone receptors and their down stream signal transduction molecules. We are currently focusing on identifying the target proteins the mediate the anti-proliferative signaling by artemisinin and assessing the synergistic anti-proliferative effects of combinations of artemisinin and other anti-cancer phytochemicals on human reproductive cancer cells both in cellular and in vivo contexts. In a complementary area of research, we have uncovered the first direct mechanistic connection between glucocorticoid receptor action and tight junction formation (and induction of cell polarity) under conditions in which mammary epithelial tumor cells undergo a stringent cell cycle arrest. In a multistep process, glucocorticoids were found to stimulate the recruitment of the tight and adherens junction proteins as well as key cell signaling molecules to the sites of cell-cell contact, which is followed by a distinct step that mediates tight junction sealing, and subsequent formation of a polarized cell monolayer. Key transcription events in this cascade include the glucocorticoid stimulated expression of the helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulatory molecule Id-1 and its beta-catenin target protein, as well as the stimulated expression of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase, Sgk, which is an important cell signaling component that we originally discovered. An important extension of this work has been to show that glucocorticoids regulate junctional complex organization in human endometrial cancer cells through a mechanism by requires the activation of cancer cell growth factor receptor signaling pathways. We plan to continue to functionally define the steroid regulated components in the glucocorticoid induced cascades that control junctional organization in order to dissect the signaling pathways that mediate cell-cell interactions and to test their potential roles in epithelial cell tumorigenesis.

My research often takes advantage of data from genomics, molecular phylogenies, developmental biology, and functional studies. Much of my work also involves the development of new tools or ways of knowing. Current projects in my group center on: understanding how biodiversity changes on geologic timescales, and on how molecular phylogenetic data and the fossil record might be used synergistically to understand the processes responsible for changes in diversity; the calibration of molecular clocks; and, the import of new genomic data on our understanding of the Cambrian explosion. Graduate students are encouraged to develop their own research projects, and to take maximum advantage of depth of talent that characterizes the UCMP, Integrative Biology and the Berkeley campus.

       " 'Howard Isaacson': \"Research Interests I am interested in the study of planets that orbit around stars other than our sun, aka exoplanets. As part of NASA's Kepler Space Mission and the California Planet Search team, I work to characterize the size, mass, density and composition of the exoplanets discovered that are the most like the Earth. Our team accomplishes this by combining photometric measurements of stars' brightness collected by Kepler with radial velocity measurements of individual stars collected with the Keck Telescope and HIRES spectrometer located on the top of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawai'i.The overarching goal of my research is to try to find planets that most resemble the Earth in their size, compotion, and distance from their host star. I am also interested in stellar activity, specifically measured by the spectral features produced in the chromospheres of stars. By studying these features, we can improve our radial velocity measurement precision, and uncover patterns in other stars that are similar to the different stellar activity cycles that we observe in the sun. Stellar activity on timescales of days, months, and years can be used to determine the rotation period, and timescale of stellar activity cycles. My collaboraters include Geoff Marcy, Andrew Howard, Erik Petigura, Lauren Weiss, Lea Hirsch, BJ Fulton, and Evan Sinukoff. Personal Interests In my free time I enjoy reading about both science and science fiction, and promoting Astronomy to the public. I also enjoying playing soccer, cycling and traveling. Biography I was born and raised under the dark skies of Butte Montana. My interest in Astronomy began when I was shown Saturn through a telescope by Lloyd Magnuson, my middle school science teacher. After meandering through interest in different sciences, I landed at the Physics and Astronomy Department at San Francisco State University in San Francisco, California. There I collected both and undergraduate and Master's Degree working with Dr. Debra Fischer, focusing my research on exoplanet detection and stellar activity measurements. After graduation, I began with working at UC Berkeley on the, then recently launched, Kepler Space Mission operated out of NASA Ames Research Center. While the Kepler Space Telescope has ended its primary mission, it is still working with the new moniker K2, and there is still much work to be done.

In particular, I aminterested in how the standards and categories imposed on the world by informational and technological systems can discriminate by supporting the development of self-respect for some and hindering its development for others.

For more information, please visit: http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~johnlab/measures.htm Co-Principal Investigator, The Mills Longitudinal Study: The Mills Lab Most of my research can be thought of in terms of two interrelated programs of inquiry. Both programs examine the concepts and categories used to describe people. However, I have studied these concepts and categories from two perspectives--both from both the perspective of social psychology (traits as concepts people use to understand themselves and others) and from the perspective of personality psychology (traits as attributes of people). Thus, one of my research programs examines the ways in which individuals use social concepts to construe their own personalities (self-perception theory) and those of others (social perception; stereotyping), and the consequences that these construals have for their behaviors, experiences, and life outcomes. The second research program addresses fundamental issues in developing a scientific taxonomy of personality attributes; this work has focused on the major taxonomic model in personality theory and assessment--the Five Factor Model of personality. The first program of research has have contributed extensively to the literature on the social-cognitive processes underlying the use of personality concepts, especially principles of categorization such as hierarchy, basic level, prototypes, and automatic processing. Much of my work has focused on the way people use personality concepts, such as traits, states, emotions, and activities, and I have studied the structure, content, and processing of these concepts. Moreover, self-perceptions and social perceptions often have important consequences, both for people\\'s own lives and those of others. For example, in research on the Five-Factor Model in adolescents, I have shown effects on such important outcome variables as juvenile delinquency, pathology, and school performance; in research on personality and self-concept structure in the Mills college sample, I have found that effects on well-being, depression, and other emotional problems persisted over several decades in the women\\'s lives; in research on the accuracy of self-perception, we have found self-enhancement bias related to psychological maladjustment and narcissism; and in several studies of self- reports of emotional expressivity, we were able to predict emotion-expressive behavior, both in peer ratings and laboratory observations. place Selected Publications John, O.

My goal is to elucidate basic physical rules that can be applied to different kinds of organisms about how body structure affects mechanical function in nature. I combine techniques from fluid and solid mechanics with those from biology to do experiments in the field as well as in the laboratory. Using both organisms and physical models, I have studied a variety of problems: the fluid dynamics of how molecules are captured by olfactory antennae and how food particles are filtered from the water by aquatic animals, the mechanisms by which bottom-dwelling marine organisms withstand waves and currents, the evolution of aerodynamic performance in insects and gliding vertebrates, the dispersal of chemical cues and of larvae in turbulent aquatic habitats, and the mechanics of how shape changes are produced in soft-bodied animals and developing embryos. I investigate structure and function on several levels of organization: tissue, organismal, and environmental. I place a strong emphasis on field work as well as on laboratory experimentation.

       " 'James Hurley': 'James Hurley Contact Info Judy C. Webb Chair and Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Lab Homepage: http://membrane.berkeley.edu/ Full Directory Information Research Interests The interplay between proteins and membrane lipids is central to almost every aspect of cell biology. This laboratory is interested in fundamental questions of how the interactions between proteins and membranes determine cell and organelle shape and the evolution of shape over time, how protein-membrane interactions turn on and off the signals that control essential cell processes, and how pathogens such as HIV-1 subvert and co-opt these interactions. The roots of our research program are in the power of x-ray crystallography to reveal the structures of membrane-interacting proteins at high resolution, leading to insights in the physical basis of protein-membrane interactions. Crystallography continues to be at the heart of our research because of its unequaled power to reveal the shape of proteins and the atomic basis for protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. The reconstitution of membrane remodeling pathways in synthetic membrane systems has taken on equal importance in the lab. These core approaches are complemented by studies in solution or on membranes by hydrodynamic, small angle x-ray scattering, fluorescence imaging, and electron microscopy. Current Projects The ESCRT System The ESCRT complexes catalyze one of the most unusual and mysterious membrane remodeling reactions in the cell. ESCRTs are responsible for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in eukaryotic cells, remarkable structures that are required for transport of receptors and other membrane proteins to the lysosome. ESCRTs promote the budding of membrane away from cytosol, in other words, in the opposite direction from clathrin and other vesicle coats. The ESCRTs appear to promote this unusual mode of budding by forming an assembly at the bud neck, so as to temporarily stabilize the bud. The ESCRTs then go on to sever the membrane neck so as to release the bud. This membrane severing reaction is essential not only for MVB biogenesis, but also for the final severing of the narrow membrane neck separating two daughter cells during cytokinesis, for the release of microvesicles from the plasma membrane, and for the release of HIV-1 and a number of other viruses from the plasma membrane of infected cells. Our group has been developing a structural hypothesis for this unique membrane budding and severing pathway. The current focus of the lab is to understand at the structural and mechanistic level how the ESCRTs are co-opted by HIV-1 so as to release nascent virions from infected cells. Autophagy Autophagy is a form of cellular self-cannibalism that appears at first glance to be bizarre and harmful. Yet autophagy is conserved throughout eukaryotes and profoundly important for cellular health and survival. Defects in autophagy in single-celled organisms impair survival under starvation and stress. In humans, dysfunction in autophagy is linked to most of the major ailments of the developed world, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Autophagy proceeds by the engulfment of cytosol, organelles, and inclusions by a growing double-membraned sheet. The double membrane becomes sealed and fuses with the lysosome (or vacuole in yeast), and its contents are hydrolyzed and recycled. Many, if not most, of the proteins required for autophagy have been identified, yet little is known about how they work with each other and with membranes to carry out this remarkable pathway. Our laboratory has solved the structure of a large portion of the Atg1 complex, which is responsible for initiating autophagy. We have developed a structural model for how the Atg1 complex might tether together the very earliest membrane vesicles involved in autophagosome biogenesis. The group now has a strong focus on building up an integrated structural model for autophagosome formation. Cargo sorting into coated vesicles: host function and viral co-optation In comparison to the counter-intuitive and poorly understood ESCRT and autophagy pathways, far more is known about coated vesicle formation at the level of molecular mechanism. Because so much of the groundwork has already been done in this field, we can ask subtle and sophisticated questions about the structural mechanisms of regulation and the redirection of basic functions by pathogens. Cargo adaptors typically link membrane proteins to coat components. We have been focusing on the AP family of heterotetrameric adaptor complexes. We were recently able to resolve a question that had stood in this field for 20 years: how the small GTPase Arf1 activates AP complexes for cargo binding. Other current efforts focus on the multiple ways that HIV-1 subverts the normal functions of the AP complexes, redirecting them to undermine the cell’s own defenses. HIV-1:host interactions of this type are attractive as novel drug targets, because host proteins are not subject to the same rapid mutation as HIV proteins, and are therefore less susceptible to the emergence of drug resistance.

       " 'Henk Roelink': 'Henk Roelink Contact Info Professor of Genetics, Genomics and Development Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/roelink Full Directory Information Research Interests The Roelink lab is interested in the mechanisms of embryonic induction, the phenomenon in which a group of cells changes the developmental fate of neighboring cells via the release of inducers. The molecular nature of these inducers is known and they belong to a relatively small number of families of signaling molecules. Invariably these molecules are involved both in the maintenance or differentiation of adult stem cells as well as in cancer. We are particularly interested in those inducers that are critical for neural tube patterning; Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and members of the BMP and Wnt families. We are using both neuralized Embryonic Stem (ES) cells as well as chicken embryos to assess the effects of inducers and the molecules involved in their distribution, reception and intracellular signal transduction. We apply this knowledge to instruct embryonic stem cells to differentiate in vitro into desired cell types. Current Projects The role of Disp1 in the distribution of Shh Dispatched1 (Disp1) encodes a widely expressed twelve transmembrane domain protein with a putative sterol-sensing domain and is required for paracrine Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. In the absence of Disp1 function, Shh is largely retained in Shh-producing cells, suggesting a role for Disp1 in the export of Shh and establishment of a long-range Shh gradient. The precise role of Disp1 in releasing lipid-modified Shh from Shh-expressing cells remains unclear, however, we envisage two possible Disp1 functions in Shh-expressing cells; the polarized trafficking of Shh or formation or release of soluble Shh complexes. We derive neural tissues from ES cells, and take advantage of the many ES lines in existence with specific genetic defects, including those that do not have functional Disp1 genes. Using these cells we can both address the requirement for Disp1 in cells that express Shh, as well as in the cells that respond to Shh. Effect of Shh binding molecules in the extra-cellular space on the range of Shh signaling Since Shh has two membrane anchors, but nevertheless signal over a long range, it is no surprise that there are several molecules that bind Shh in the extracellular space and influence the range of Shh. We are investigating both the role of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) and Hhip in Shh distribution. HSPGs are large molecules that occupy a significant fraction of the extracellular space, that bind many signaling molecules, including Shh. We are testing the ability of ES cells deficient for Ext1, which is required for Heparan Sulfate synthesis, to produce, release and respond to Shh. Hhip is a transmembrane protein that binds Shh in attenuates the Shh response, presumably by preventing transport of Shh, or binding of Shh to its receptor. However, despite the presence of a transmembrane domain, Hhip is able to inhibit the Shh response several cell diameters away from where it is synthesized. This in turn implies that Hhip, despite the presence of a trans-membrane domain, is released from cells. We are very interested how Shh and Hhip, proteins expected to be membrane bound, still have effects several cell diameters away form their sites of synthesis. Deriving specific neurons from ES cells Embryonic Stem cells have the capacity to make any cell type present in an organism, and as such are the most powerful source of cells to generate differentiated cells and tissues in vitro for transplantation purposes. During development, stem cells acquire their ultimate phenotype in response to inductive signals present in their immediate environment, and in principle, it is possible to create cell culture conditions that would result in widespread differentiation of the desired cell type. We are defining conditions to generate specific neuronal cell types in ES cell-derived neuralized Embryoid Bodies by using combinations of Shh, BMPs and Wnts as well as their antagonists.

Research Molecular Biology of Plant Reproduction Pollen Tube Growth We studied pollen-specific receptor kinases and how they perceive and transduce signals for pollen tube growth. We used yeast two hybrid screens to identify potential ligands; these include LAT52 and LeSHY, pollen proteins, and LeSTIG1, a stigma-specific protein. We think that the receptor kinases interact with different ligands during different phases of pollen tube growth. We also used yeast two hybrid screens to identify cytoplasmic partners for these receptor kinases; one partner, called KPP, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rops. Rops are small GTPases. Thus our work provides a link from receptor kinases to the Rop-mediated cytoplasmic dynamics that are needed for pollen tube growth. Pollen tubes (stained with decolorized aniline blue) growing through a tomato style. Pollen development and function About 10% of the genes in plants are specifically or selectively expressed in pollen, but the functions of most are not understood. We used Arabidopsis to identify mutants that are defective at a stage of pollen development, or during pollen hydration, pollen tube growth, pollen tube guidance, or fertilization. Usually such mutants have altered transmission through the male parent, but do not affect the female. The giftwrap pollen mutant has what appears to be ribbons tied in bows inside the pollen grain (stained with decolorized aniline blue). Gamete Biology We were interested in double fertilization, specifically in how the two sperm and their fusion partners, the egg and the central cell, recognize and fuse with each other. To develop tools for this objective, we generated cDNA libraries from maize sperm, eggs, and embryo sacs, sequenced ~20,000 ESTs, then used these datasets as starting points to identify gamete-specific genes. We identified promoter elements that will drive gamete-specific gene expression. We then used Arabidopsis to identify T-DNA insertions in gamete-expressed genes, and test whether there is a phenotype. We have evidence that fertilization fails when some of these genes are disrupted. Pollen grains whose sperm cells are expressing GFP from a sperm-specific promoter.

By using T cell development and immune responses in the mouse as model systems, we can take advantage of the powerful genetic approaches available in the mouse, while learning about a mammalian immune system that is very close to our own. Our lab also makes extensive use of 2-photon imaging approaches to observe and analyze T cell behavior in real-time in situ. Current Projects The control of T cell fate in the thymus. During thymic development, T cell precursors migrate to the thymus where they proliferate, rearrange their antigen receptor genes, and eventually give rise to the mature T cell subsets. During this process, the thymocytes are subject to a selection process that results in the death of ~99% of the cells and that shapes the mature T cell repertoire. We are investigating the mechanism that lead to positive and negative selection of T cells in the thymus, as well as the signaling events that control to cell fate decisions, including the CD4 versus CD8 cell lineage choice. Immune responses to parasitic infection . Our lab is investigating host-pathogen interactions using a mouse infection model of the intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii . We have established mouse infection models that enable us to quantitiate immune responses to the parasites in vivo and to visualize immune responses in real-time. Our ongoing efforts in this area are focused on examining CD8 T cell responses during priming and effector phases of the immune response, and to examining immune protection during chronic infection. For additional info go to http://mcb.berkeley.edu/chpr/ During T cell development in the thymus, thymocyte precursors that express both CD4 and CD8 undergo a process of cellular selection and lineage commitment. Potentially auto-reactive T cells whose antigen receptors can interact strongly with self are eliminated through negative selection. Thymocytes that lack antigen receptors, or whose antigen receptors cannot interact with MHC ligands are eliminated by programmed cell death. Thymocytes whose antigen receptors have weak reactivity to class I MHC are selected to develop into mature CD8+ T cells. Thymocytes whose antigen receptors have weak reactivity to class II MHC are selected to develop into mature CD4 lineage T cells.

Education MA Art History, Mills College MFA Painting and Graphics, California College of Arts & Crafts Philosophy Statement I am interested in the illusion and reality of space as it is depicted in both traditional and non traditional art forms. 2D and 3D space in computer rendering has a remarkable visual unreality about it, an unreality that has infinite variety. I search in this enormous variety for bases of conceptual thought. Biography Professor Penny (Margaret) Dhaemers was called back from retirement in 1996 to continue to teach courses in Computer Graphics Rendering and Animation (ARCH 129, 138, 139X, 229). The program includes guest lecturers and field trips to course-appropriate locations. The syllabus in the class website underlined below delineates the curriculum and shows examples of the work. Dhaemers was the fifth chairman of the Department of Design, CED, from 1970-1974, and chair of the Program for Visual Design from 1974-1976. Until 2005, she was the only female chair in the history of the CED. After 1976, when all the programs on the campus were required to be located in a department, a highly active Visual Studies Study Area was incorporated into Architecture. The Visual Studies faculty became part of the Departments of Art, Architecture and Landscape Architecture as chosen by each. From 1976 until 1994, Dhaemers was chair of the Visual Studies Committee. Dhaemers was an NEA grant recipient. Involved with multimedia since the seventies, she was associated with the National Center of Experiments in Television (NCET) of KQED and regularly received equipment grants. She was co-producer of video productions with Professor Emeritus Willard Rosenquist and Tom Hutchinson of the Media Center using imaging, dancers and computer musicians. They produced Digressions, and Light Gestures. Her book reviews include CPM for the Kaypro, Computer Graphics: A Survey of Current Techniques and Applications by John Lewell, for the Design Book Review . One of her major photographic projects was the visual and detailed examination of the Maybeck Recital Hall on Euclid Ave in Berkeley. She is represented in many collections with photographic, art and computer art works appearing in numerous publications: Arts and Architecture ; she was featured in the PC World article Dynamic Design: CAD for Arts Sake by Janette Martin; she wrote many articles for the American Society of Media Photographers professional bulletins including an autobiographical article. Fleeting Electronics: Electronically induced Still Images; she was one of the featured digital pioneers in Digital Pioneers, a book on Digital Photography by Mikkel Aalund, Random House, 1992, etc. From Sept. to Nov. 2000: Dhaemers images defining and displaying Videospace were amongst the featured aspects of an exhibit curated by Steve Seid of the UC Art Museum showing the experimental work of NCET. Until 2005, Dhaemers had served on the campus Dorothea Lange and Eisner committees for many years. She was a mentor for Elizabeth Lane, Philosophy major, who competed in the HAAS Scholarship Program Award, 2003-04. Lane\\'s thesis, \"The Elderly Among Us,\" was a photographic presentation. Dhaemers is a continuing member of the CED Distinguished Alumni Awards committee (2005-09), was a member of a faculty position search committee in 2008, and was a member of the Dean’s Search Committee from 2008-09. She was and is an affiliated faculty member of the BCNM (Berkeley Center for New Media) 2007-09 located in the new CITRIS building on Hearst Street on the campus.

       " 'Hillel Adesnik': \"Hillel Adesnik Contact Info Assistant Professor of Neurobiology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs2/adesnik/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Our brain is responsible for all our perceptions, thoughts and actions. Despite the incredible array of processes the brain performs - from memory to emotion - its elementary units of function are the nerve cell and the synaptic junction. How is it that a collection of neurons and their synapses gives rise to all of animal and human behavior? In mammals and especially in humans, the cerebral cortex is an area of the brain that is crucially involved in nearly all cognitive functions. Individual neurons in the cortex can make over 10,000 connections with other brain cells. The precise pattern of connections between a local group of neurons in the cortex gives rises to its elementary unit of computation - the cortical microcircuit. The goal of our laboratory is to reveal the neural basis of perception. More specifically, we want to understand exactly how cortical microcircuits process sensory information to drive behavior. While decades of research have carefully outlined how individual neurons extract specific features from the sensory environment, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that permit ensembles of cortical neurons to actually process sensory information and generate perceptions are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question of modern neuroscience requires working at both the cellular and system-wide level to assess how populations of neurons cooperate to encode information, generate perceptions, and execute behavioral decisions. Towards this end, we monitor and and then manipulate specific subsets of genetically identified neurons in awake behaving mice to quantitatively determine their contribution to sensory processing and behavior. By turning neurons 'on' and 'off' using optogenetic and pharmacogenetic approaches, we can identify groups of cortical neurons that are both necessary and sufficient for specific neural computations. By complementing our in vivo work with detailed analysis of synaptic connectivity and network dynamics in vitro, we hope to arrive at a more complete understanding for how neural circuits in our brain support sensation, cognition, and action. Our lab is also developing a suite of novel optical and genetic approaches to manipulate neural circuits in the intact brain and at far greater resolution than is possible with current techniques. These new tecniques will allow us to address fundamental questions about sensory computation and perception that have as yet eluded investigation. Current Projects There are three major aims of our research. Our first goal is to understand the role of horizontal and vertical connections across each of the six major cortical layers in computing the size, shape, and texture of sensory objects. Horizontal connections that connect cortical columns are likely to play a critical role in these processes by providing a context for sensory stimuli in space. We take advantage of the mouse 'barrel' cortex in which each cortical column represents one whisker on the face. Using multi-electrode array recordings, two photon imaging, and in vivo whole cell voltage clamp recordings in the barrel cortex of awake, actively whisking mice we are dissecting the cortical circuits responsible for encoding and decoding tactile stimuli. The second goal of the lab is to develop new high-speed and spatially precise optical approaches to manipulate neural activity at the level of single neurons in the intact brains of awake, behaving animals to decipher the neural code that underlies sensory perception. By combining non-linear optics with optogenetics we aim to control the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons at single cell resolution, providing the key tool to understand how patterns of action potentials in space and time represent the external world. Our third goal is to understand how global activity across mutliple sensory, motor and associational cortical areas, synthesizes specfic perceptions and selects the appropriate behavioral response to a given set of environmental conditions. We combine whole brain imaging approaches with targeted electrophysiology to reveal how communication within and across cortical areas cooperate to generate specific percepts. Our hope is that by understanding how the brain generates perceptions at the level of synapses and circuits we will not only come to a much deeper appreciation for the biological mechanisms underlying brain function, but also reveal new avenues to treat neurological disease such as autism, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and movement disorders.

She did her dissertation on a mutual aid group for women alcoholics, Women For Sobriety. Her early research was on the effectiveness of warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers. She has conducted cost effectiveness health services trials comparing medical/clinical model treatment to social/community model treatment. She has studied the utilization of Alcoholics Anonymous over time among treated and untreated problem and dependent drinkers, and the role of helping. She developed and conducted trials of two interventions. The first is a computer-based assessment and intervention focused on drink sizes, for use in prenatal clinics, aimed to help pregnant women understand how much they are drinking. The second is a manual-guided 12-step facilitation intervention for delivery in group settings by counselors in recovery. It is called MAAEZ, Making AA Easier. She has developed several scales, including one that measures AA involvement, another that captures the program philosophy of treatment programs, and a third that measures helping activities in recovery; a fourth scale measuring recovery is in progress. Current Projects: First project: Working with diverse individuals in recovery, to understand how they define recovery. The field knows a lot about the problems associated with alcohol and drug abuse, but very little about the positive and productive ways of being that are associated with recovery from alcohol and drugs. The goal of the study is to come up with a psychometrically valid Recovery Scale that defines recovery. Second project: Studying the course of drinking and service utilization over 11 years among untreated problem drinkers. The study uses latent class growth curve analyses to study the role of treatment versus self-help and social network support. Third project: Directing training at the Alcohol Research Group. The project supports three pre-docs and four post-docs. Selected Publications: Kaskutas L.A. , Subbaraman M., Witbrodt J, Zemore S.

Mathias Kondolf Professor of Landscape Architecture & Environmental Planning Specializations Hydrology; environmental geology; environmental impact assessment; riparian zone management. Emphasis on stream channel processes as they relate to natural resource management. Education PhD, Geography and Environmental Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University MS Earth Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz AB Cum Laude, Geology, Princeton University Philosophy Statement There is something vital about rivers, and irresistible. Whether seeking the flash of a salmon, or feeling your boat pulled into the next rapid, or falling asleep to the sound of water roaring down a steep mountain channel, moving water exerts strong magic on most of us, inspiring no shortage of analogies (life is a river, you cannot step in the same river twice). Within cities, rivers provide compelling opportunities for open space, ecological restoration, and community gathering – especially as former industrial waterfronts become accessible to human populations. In rural areas, we can step back from rivers to allow them room to erode, deposit, and thereby create their own complex channel forms and riparian forests – the ‘espace de liberté’ concept. In my classes, I emphasize understanding of physical and ecological process and river history as a basis for restoration strategy, the need to learn from each restoration project, and the need for scientific rigor when approaching restoration. Biography G. Mathias (Matt) Kondolf is a fluvial geomorphologist and environmental planner, specializing in environmental river management and restoration. As Professor of Environmental Planning at UC Berkeley, he teaches courses in hydrology, river restoration, and environmental science. His research focuses on human-river interactions, with emphasis on managing of flood-prone lands (‘wise use’ of floodplains), managing sediment in rivers and reservoirs (with recent work in the Mekong River basin), and river restoration, and has written scientific papers, books, and reports on these topics. Dr Kondolf has served on National Academy of Science panels, the Calfed Ecosystem Restoration Science Board, and the Environmental Advisory Board to the Chief of the US Army Corps of Engineers, and as Clarke Scholar at the Institute for Water Resources of the US Army Corps.

       " 'Naomi Ginsberg': \"Research Area(s): Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Biophysics Condensed Matter Physics And Materials Science Biography Naomi S. Ginsberg received a B.A.Sc. degree in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto in 2000 and a Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard University in 2007. She held a Glenn T. Seaborg Postdoctoral Fellowship at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory until her appointment as Assistant Professor in the Chemistry department at UC Berkeley in 2010. Naomi joined the Physics faculty in 2011. She currently holds the Cupola Era Endowed Chair in the College of Chemistry, is a Faculty Scientist in the Physical Biosciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and is the recipient of a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering (2011). Naomi's research is in the areas of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Biophysics, Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science. Research Interests Work in the Ginsberg Group is motivated by the need to spatially and temporally resolve the complex dynamics of nanoscale processes, such as photosynthetic light harvesting. We use multiple approaches, separately and in combination, including ultrafast spectroscopy, light microscopy, and cathodoluminescence electron mocroscopy. Current Projects I. Mapping spatio-temporal photoexcitation trajectories onto the architecture of photosynthetic light harvesters In photosynthesis, solar-to-chemical energy conversion begins with chlorophyll photoexcitation and its ultrafast energy transfer through a heterogeneous network of integral membrane pigment-protein complexes. The ultimate destination is the reaction center protein, where the excitation leads to charge separation that triggers transduction to chemical fuels. Remarkably, nearly every photoexcitation leads to charge separation, yet the reason for this high quantum efficiency is unclear. We seek to uncover the underlying mechanisms of this targeted excitation energy transfer by probing photosynthetic membranes and synthesized mimics such as polymers, molecular crystals, and inorganic nanostructures intended for photovoltaic applications. Photoexcitations can travel many tens of nanometers without being quenched and do so much faster than typical molecular fluorescence lifetimes. By borrowing elements from fluorescence microscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy, we are interested in dynamically mapping distributions of traveling photoexcitations as a function of energy, space, and time. Specifically in photosynthesis, we have only begun to learn the means by which molecular arrangement, the resulting Coulomb coupling between chlorophylls, and protein-induced energy fluctuations cooperatively yield high quantum efficiency transport. A more profound understanding is critical to unlocking nature's strategies for successful light harvesting. Artificial devices tend to suffer from limited excitation diffusion lengths prior to charge separation but can be more robust to photodamage. By observing dynamics in both naturally occurring and 'man-made' light harvesters, we will be poised to compare and contrast them and to mitigate their weaknesses. II. Near-field cathodoluminescence microscopy The demands for and on high-resolution imaging systems continue to increase with our eagerness to visualize ever smaller features of live cells and molecular interactions. Each imaging platform involves tradeoffs between resolution, working distance, sample environment, sensitivity, and molecular specificity. With these in mind, we are interested in imaging aqueous samples at high resolution using the near-field cathodoluminescence of thin-film phosphors. This technique will achieve controllable brightness and spectral selectivity and will approach the resolution and speed of electron microscopy, without the complications of mechanical scanning at close range or sample fixation. Cathodoluminescence is the electron-beam induced generation of optical excitations in materials, by analogy to photoluminescence (light-induced) or electroluminescence (electronically-induced). It is an attractive alternative to visualizing the underlying mechanisms of complex molecular phenomena. The key idea in our studies is to leverage the focusing ability of electron optics to make nanoscopic scanned optical spots that can be used for a broad range of imaging applications. This will reveal information about the optical properties of nano phosphors alongside the interactions of small molecules and proteins in solution. By bringing our excited optical spots very close to encapsulated aqueous samples, we are interested in revisiting optical probes of distance, binding, and aggregation such as Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). This makes it possible to explore the effects of heterogeneity that may be washed out with diffraction-limited observation volumes and to work in the single-molecule regime at high concentrations. We are also interested in using this novel light source to perform precise fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) diffusion studies of photosynthetic and other membrane structures at unprecedentedly small length scales.

I have conducted over 30 months of ethnographic fieldwork on agrarian micro-politics in Eastern Zimbabwe. This work explores the cultural politics of landscape and identity, focusing on both colonial and postcolonial governmentality, those assemblages of practice that promote self-disciplining subjects. I use both historical and ethnographic prisms to examine racialized regimes of rule in southern Africa, notably conflicts over land, labor, and livelihood. This ethnographic work on situated struggles tries to bring a more enlivened spatial sensitivity to contemporary anthropological formulations of the cultural politics of place, power, and identity. A brief period of field research in South Africa focused on post-apartheid land claims and the cultural politics of recognition and redistribution. More recent work maps an emergent field of the cultural politics of race and nature. How do race and nature work as contested terrains of power? Drawing from Race Critical Theory, postcolonial theory, and the field of environmental politics, this project tracks the traffic between nature and culture that routes through historically specific formations of racism. Part of this work resulted in a collaborative project that produced the co-edited Race, Nature, and the Politics of Difference (Duke, 2003). On campus, I am one of the core faculty members in the interdisciplinary Environmental Politics initiative, housed within the Institute of International Studies. I remain actively involved in African Studies; in the African Diaspora Program (within African-American Studies); and with the Graduate Group in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. Inside the department, my research and teaching interests include: governmentality; cultural politics; spatiality and power; environment and development; race and the politics of difference; and postcolonial theory.

He holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in Computation and Neural Systems from the California Institute of Technology.  He did his postdoctoral work in the Department of Psychology at Cornell University and at the Center for Biological and Computational Learning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  From 1996-2005 he was on the faculty in the Center for Neuroscience at UC Davis, and in 2005 he moved to UC Berkeley.  He also directs the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, a multidisciplinary research group focusing on building mathematical and computational models of brain function (see http://redwood.berkeley.edu). Olshausen's research focuses on understanding the information processing strategies employed by the visual system for tasks such as object recognition and scene analysis.  Computer scientists have long sought to emulate the abilities of the visual system in digital computers, but achieving performance anywhere close to that exhibited by biological vision systems has proven elusive.  Dr. Olshausen's approach is based on studying the response properties of neurons in the brain and attempting to construct mathematical models that can describe what neurons are doing in terms of a functional theory of vision.  The aim of this work is not only to advance our understanding of the brain but also to devise new algorithms for image analysis and recognition based on how brains work.\",\n",

We do this using concepts and methods developed by considering contemporary statistical mechanics unified when appropriate with principles from disparate disciplines in theoretical science. We ultimately aim to derive effective theories and coarse-grained descriptions and do so with the help of modern numerical techniques and computer simulation. Inspiration for specific problems comes from close collaboration with experimentalists studying real physical systems in microscopic or mesoscopic detail. Specific areas of current interest include the emergent behavior of systems undergoing simple chemical dynamics in complex environments, the response of nanoscale systems driven far from equilibrium and the solid-electrolyte interfaces relevant to basic energy science.

Botany Southampton University, England, 1961 Research Environmental plant biology, phytoremediation and botanical drug development PHYTOREMEDIATION Environmental pollution is a major threat to our planet. Pollution of precious water supplies is particularly egregious. Electric utilities, oil refineries, and chemical plants produce billions of gallons of contaminated wastewater each year. In agriculture, toxic levels of various elements pollute the groundwater as a result of excessive fertilizer application (e.g., nitrates and phosphates), and through leaching of naturally occurring trace elements in the soil after irrigation (e.g., selenium). Pollution of both water and soil poses a significant hazard to human health. Finding suitable treatment technologies to clean up contaminated water and soil wastewater is not easy. The few technologies that are available are usually prohibitively expensive. Because the need for practical and cost-effective procedures for cleaning up contaminated water and soil is so great, researchers at the Terry lab have dedicated themselves to achieving this goal through phytoremediation, a cost-effective and environment-friendly approach for cleanup. Over the past 18 years, we have had demonstrable success in cleaning up contaminated wastewater and soil (see nature.berkeley.edu/terrylab ). CURRENT RESEARCH - BORON REMEDIATION In order to use plants to remediate B, first we have to elucidate the biochemical mechanism by which plants interact with B. Plants that are able to tolerate high concentrations of B do so using one of two main mechanisms. The first mechanism is to \"exclude\" B. Certain plants have developed methods to prevent B from entering the roots, or are able to pump the B out of the roots once it enters. This prevents the element from entering the plant tissue and negatively affecting plant health. The second method is to \"sequester\" B. Certain plants are able to complex B and sequester it in their tissues, thereby protecting the sensitive areas of the plant. When a plant has the ability to sequester the majority of B in the aboveground tissues, it is termed a \"hyperaccumulator\". In our laboratory, in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Mehmet Babaoglu from the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Selcuk, Turkey, we are studying both B-excluding and B-hyperaccumulator plants. Our study of these plants focuses on determining the upper limit of B tolerance, as well as the mechanisms these plants use to tolerate high concentrations of B in the soil. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that some plant species are able to withstand extremely high B concentrations. While B did accumulate in the plant tissue during our preliminary experiment, it only accumulated to a concentration approximately twice that of the external B concentration. This indicates that this plant species is successfully preventing the uptake of high concentrations of B. Our next goals are to determine the upper limits of B tolerance and to elucidate, at the biochemical level, how the plant is able to protect itself so effectively from such high concentrations of B. Other plant species growing in high B soils are able to accumulate B in their aboveground tissues at concentrations 25-30 times that of the external B concentration. Our next goal is to determine how the plant is able to tolerate such high concentrations of B in its aboveground tissue. Bacteria exist that are able to live and thrive in high concentrations of boron. These are known as extremophiles, because they are able to live in conditions that would be toxic to the majority of living organisms. While some bacteria are simply able to tolerate high concentrations of boron, other types of bacteria actually require high concentrations of boron. In our laboratory, we are currently working to isolate bacteria from soil samples collected from high boron soils. Once these bacteria have been isolated, we can then work to understand the mechanisms they use to tolerate high concentrations of boron. We hope to transfer these abilities to fast-growing, high-biomass plants, and thereby utilize plants as a form of remediation. MEDICINAL PLANTS The most recent focus of the Terry Lab is the study of medicinal plants. The long-term goal of this research is to rationalize the process of development and production of Chinese herbs for medicinal purposes. The Lab is currently working on two plants, Saussurea involucrata (snow lotus) and Artemisia annua. Snow lotus extract has been used for centuries in China as a treatment for many ailments, and we are particularly interested in its anti-inflammatory effect on rheumatoid arthritis. Snow lotus grows naturally only in a very specific and limited habitat (high in the Himalayan mountains). Its natural population is suffering from over-harvesting. As a consequence, we are seeking to develop methods for the large-scale production of snow lotus through tissue culture and hydroponics. Our second goal is to develop a standardized procedure for the production of extracts of consistently high quality. Snow lotus extract has been used for centuries in China as a treatment for many ailments, and we are particularly interested in its anti-inflammatory effect on rheumatoid arthritis. Snow lotus is an herb that grows naturally only in very specific and limited habitats. The goals of our research are: 1) to develop methods to produce high quantities of snow lotus biomass in the laboratory through either tissue culture techniques or via hydroponics, and 2) to develop a standardized procedure for production of an extract of consistently high quality. Artemisia produces the anti-malarial drug, artemisinin. Our laboratory is researching methods to increase the production of artemisinin in the plant through biotechnology and by manipulating environmental variables. Recent Publications I.

Vollhardt': 'Professor of Chemistry email: kpcv@berkeley.edu office: 635 Latimer phone: 510.642.0286 fax: 510.643.5208 lab phone: 510.642.9857 Research Group Recent Publications Research Interests Organic and Organometallic Chemistry — Transition metals and novel synthetic methodology enable the synthesis of complex natural and unnatural products. Professor Vollhardt and his coworkers are interested in the application of transition metals to organic synthesis. The areas under investigation range from the assembly of novel oligometallic arrays to the use of cobalt, palladium, and nickel in the construction of complex organic molecules. For example, his group has developed ways to attach cyclopentadienylmetal units repeatedly to other p-ligands, such as cyclopentadienyl itself. In this way, a number of potentially catalytic and conducting oligocyclopentadienylmetals with remarkable properties have become available for further exploration. A second effort underway is directed at further exploring the scope of the cobalt-mediated [2+2+2]cycloaddition of alkynes to other unsaturated substrates, a reaction pioneered by the Vollhardt group. Recent work has focused on \"tagging\" heteroaromatic systems, such as the indole alkaloids, resulting in a total synthesis of strychnine and a novel approach to morphinoids. A third problem is concerned with the synthesis of molecules of theoretical importance, in particular highly strained hydrocarbons and molecules with electronically destabilizing features. These include the phenylenes, a class of novel benzenoids in which benzene and cyclobutadiene are fused in an alternating manner. Their properties are remarkable, in particular with respect to cyclohexatrienic reactivity of the benzene nuclei and their potential to behave as organic magnets and conductors. Biography K. Peter C. Vollhardt was born on March 7, 1946 in Madrid, Spain. He grew up there and in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he went to primary school. He then moved to Germany and completed his secondary school education in Munich, where he obtained a Vordiplom in Chemistry at the University of Munich. In 1968, he moved to University College London, to graduate with a Ph.D. in Chemistry with Professor P. J. Garratt in 1972. After two years as a postdoctoral fellow with Professor R. G. Bergman at the California Institute of Technology, he was appointed Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1975, he also became Principal Investigator of the Materials and Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. In 1978, he was promoted to Associate, in 1982 to Full Professor. From 1983 to 1987, he was also a Principal Investigator at the Center for Advanced Materials, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. He was Assistant Dean to the College of Chemistry from 1996 to 2004. He is a member of the German Chemical Society, The Chemical Society, London, the American Chemical Society, and Sigma Xi. Between 1966 and 1969, he was a Fellow and then an Overseas Fellow of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes, and, in 1975, he received a Regents\\' Summer Faculty Fellowship. He enjoyed visiting Professorships at the Universities of Paris at Orsay (1979), Bordeaux (1985), Lyon (1987), Rennes (1991), Paris VI (1992), Marseille (2000), and Rome Tor Vergata (2004). He held both an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship (1976-1980) and a Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher Scholarship (1978-1983). In 1983, he was awarded the Adolf Windaus Medal of the German Chemical Society, in addition to being selected by Science Digest as one of the \"100 Outstanding Young Scientists in America.\" During the years 1984-1989, he functioned as an Associate Editor for the journal Synthesis, to be followed by his current position as Chief Editor for Synlett, a journal he launched in 1990. He was the recipient of a Miller Research Professorship in Residence (1985-86), a Humboldt Senior Scientist Award (1985 and 1992), and the ACS Award in Organometallic Chemistry (1987). In 1987, he was also elected to the Organic Division Committee of IUPAC. He was given the Otto Bayer Prize 1990, the ACS Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award 1991, a Japan Society for Promotion of Science Award 1995, the Stiftung Buchkunst Prize (Germany) 1996, an NSF Special Creativity Award 1998, the ACS Edward Leete Award 1999, the Medal of the University Aix-Marseille 2000, and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Rome Tor Vergata 2004. Professor Vollhardt has had over 260 scientific coworkers and supervises a group of 10-15 students and postdoctorals. He has published and/or submitted for publication over 300 scientific papers or books, among the latter a sophomore textbook on organic chemistry, now in its 5th edition (Freeman and Company, 1987, 1994, 1999, 2003, 2007), which has been translated into German (Verlag Chemie, 1988, 1995, 2000, 2005), French (de Boeck-Wesmael, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2004), Italian (Zanichelli, 1990, 1998, 2004), Spanish (Ediciones Omega, 1990, 1996, 2000), Korean (Tamgu-Dang, 1993, 1997, 2004), Japanese (Kagaku-Dojin, 1996, 2000, 2004), Portuguese (Bookman, 2004), Serbian (Haydigraf, 1996; Data Status, 2004), and Chinese (Chinese Chemical Press, 2006).

Central to our research interests is the total synthesis of natural products with a keen eye toward the development of new synthetic methods and strategies. In concert with this general program, we look to nature to inspire our choice of synthetic targets (natural products) and some of our strategies (e.g., bio-mimetic approaches) to natural product synthesis. The compounds that we synthesize in our laboratory may ultimately become important as tools to study biological systems or provide a starting point for the development of therapeutics. The challenge of a total synthesis provides a unique opportunity to test the limits of synthetic methodology and to invent new reactions. The formation of carbon-carbon bonds (C-C bonds) is of fundamental importance to synthetic organic chemistry. Our group seeks to address some of the current limitations in synthetic organic chemistry by defining new directions for C-C bond formation and then validating our methodology in the arena of complex molecule synthesis. In this regard, we are interested in (A) C-C bond forming processes that are coupled with the energetically 'downhill' events of strain release and aromatization to provide new strategies to access natural product motifs, (B) the generation of metal vinylidenes under mild reaction conditions as a new entry into C-H functionalization and (C) novel access to reactive intermediates such as metallo-carbenoids and radicals. Ultimately, we anticipate that our interests will evolve, depending on a student's interest or fascinating new transformations that we encounter. Among the natural products currently of interest in our group are the teleocidin B family of indole alkaloids (potent protein kinase C tumor promoters), the cyathane diterpenoids scabronine A and erinacine E (active stimulants of nerve growth factor biosynthesis) and the trichothecane sesquiterpenoids verrucarin A and satratoxin H which are mycotoxins that also possess cytotoxic properties.

       " 'Karen Davies': 'Karen Davies Contact Info Assistant Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Full Directory Information Research Interests Energy is a fundamental necessity of all living cells. Without it, cells cannot move, grow or replicate. In eukaryotic cells, energy is generated by two specialized membrane compartments (organelles), located in the cytoplasm of the cell. One is called the mitochondria, which derives cellular energy from the breakdown of food, and the other is the chloroplast, which uses the power of sunlight to generate cellular energy. Both organelles have an intricate inner membrane system which houses the proteins responsible for converting sunlight, or the energy released from the breakdown of food, into cellular energy. The structure of the inner membrane systems is extremely important. In mitochondria, disruption of the inner membrane system is associated with many deleterious diseases in human. However, in chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria, alterations to the internal membrane system is an essential part of photoprotection. How these changes are achieved is currently unknown and this is exactly what the Davies’s lab is investigating. To achieve this, we use the technique of electron cryo-tomography and sub-tomogram averaging to directly determine the structure and arrangement of proteins in situ and the influence of these protein structures on membrane morphology. Through our research, we aim to determine which proteins are responsible for inner membrane morphology; how these proteins shape the membranes; how the morphology of the inner membrane systems influence energy production, and most importantly, how the protein complexes involved in energy production interact in the membrane to generate energy efficiently. These results will uncover fundamental principles governing energy production in eurkaryotes which can then be used to develop novel approaches for curing mitochondrial diseases and designing synthetic systems for the artificial production of electricity and biomaterial. Current Projects Biogenesis of mitochondrial cristae Mitochondria are double-membrane bound organelles located in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. While the organelle’s outer membrane is smooth, the inner membrane invaginates forming multiple protrusions called cristae. The structure of the cristae varies considerably, both between species and between different tissues of the same organism. The origin of these differences and their effect on the functioning of the organelle is currently unknown. However, in previous work I have shown that the ATP synthase form rows of dimers along the highly curved edges of lamellar cristae and that these dimer rows are directly responsible for the lamellar structure (Davies et al., 2011, 2012). The Davies’s lab is now continuing this research with the aim of understanding how the ATP synthase dimers interact with the proteins involved in cristae junction formation and also how the morphology of cristae is influenced by the structure of the ATP synthase dimers and the composition of membrane lipids. Adaptation of photosynthetic membranes to environmental changes Cyanobacteria are the precursors to the chloroplasts of land plants and green algae. Like chloroplasts, cyanobacteria have an intricate inner membrane system which houses the proteins involved in the capture of sunlight for the generation of cellular ATP. Unlike chloroplasts and land plants, cyanobacteria can be readily modified genetically and the narrow diameter of the elongatus strains make them excellent specimens for electron cryo-tomography. Using this technique, we are investigating how changes in growth conditions influence the structure of the thylakoid membrane and the organization of proteins within them. Assembly of bacterial microcompartments In collaboration with Cheryl Kerfeld and Dave Savage we are using the technique of electron cryo-tomography and single particle analysis to study the assembly and heterogeneity of bacterial microcompartments. Microcompartments are proteinases icosahedral-like structures which segregate sensitive or toxic cellular reactions from the general cytoplasm of bacteria. By understanding how microcompartments assemble and function, we aim to introduce engineered microcompartments into synthetic organisms to improve the efficiency of biomass and biopolymer production.

My approach is to first understand the long-term goals of major corporations with significant research and development activities, and then to understand how the research capabilities of UC Berkeley and partner institutions could be organized to address the needs of industry.

       " 'Daniel Rodríguez': 'Daniel A. Rodríguez Professor of City & Regional Planning Specializations Transportation Policy and Planning and Environmental Planning and Healthy Citiesspecializations. Education PhD University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2000 MS in Transportation., MIT, 1996 BS, Business Administration, Fordham University, 1994 Biography Daniel A. Rodríguez is Chancellor’s Professor of City and Regional Planning. His research focuses on the relationship between transportation, land development, and the health and environmental impacts that follow. His most recent work focuses on the health and equity impacts of urban transportation policy. In a current project he is examining the impact of transportation innovations (bus rapid transit, aerial trams, protected and unprotected bicycle lane networks) on land markets and development. In another current project, he is examining the dramatic rise in motorcycle use in Latin America. He frames this increase as an unexpected result of urban transportation policy decisions that have failed to limit the appeal of the automobile. At the same time, transit service continues to deteriorate, with fares rising and travel times suffering due to congestion. Motorcycles emerge in this context as a viable option charged with alternative meaning and opportunity, but with enormous personal risks. As a Faculty Affiliate of the Institute for Urban and Regional Development , Rodriguez is currently leading two research projects (totaling $1.1 million) related to urban health inequalities and the built environment in Latin America. In other work he has considered the land value impact of transit investment and the impact of urban form on physical activity and travelling behavior. On a regional scale, he has studied the relationship between regional policies and travel patterns and how plans can be used to strengthen the connection between transportation and land use. A majority of Professor Rodríguez’s work is driven by practical problems and finding solutions for planners and policy-makers. Working within the health, nutrition, economics, engineering, geography and public policy disciplines, he has examined how changes to the physical attributes of the environment, such as the location of bus routes, rail lines, supermarkets and trails, are related to changes in physical activity; and how land management tools can be used to encourage transit development and recapture property value increases by public action. Prior to joining Berkeley, Rodriguez served in the faculty of University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he was Distinguished Professor of Sustainable Communities in the Department of City and Regional Planning. He is a faculty fellow of the Lincoln Institute for Land Policy, and has been a consultant to the Inter-American Development Bank, Andean Development Bank, and the Clean Air Institute.

       " 'Jack Glaser': 'About Research In the News New Book: Suspect Race Areas of Expertise Political Psychology Stereotyping, Prejudice & Discrimination Research Methods Social Psychology Hate Crime Unconscious Social Cognition Racial Profiling Policing Biography Jack Glaser received his Ph.D. in psychology from Yale University in 1999 and joined the faculty of the Goldman School in 2000. He is a social psychologist whose primary research interest is in stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. He studies these intergroup biases at multiple levels of analysis. For example, he investigates the unconscious operation of stereotypes and prejudice using computerized reaction time methods, and is investigating the implications of such subtle forms of bias in law enforcement. In particular, he is interested in racial profiling , especially as it relates to the psychology of stereotyping, and the self-fulfilling effects of such stereotype-based discrimination. Additionally, Professor Glaser has conducted research on a very extreme manifestation of intergroup bias - hate crime - and has carried out analyses of historical data as well as racist rhetoric on the Internet to challenge assumptions about economic predictors of intergroup violence. Another area of interest is in electoral politics and political ideology, specifically the role of emotion (as experienced and expressed) in politics. Professor Glaser is working with the Center for Policing Equity as one of the principal investigators on a National Science Foundation- and Google-funded project to build a National Justice Database of police stops and use of force incidents.

Abstract A controlled experiment tested the possibility that racial profiling— disproportionate scrutiny of a minority racial group by sanctioned authorities—would have a “reverse deterrent” effect on the illicit behavior of members of a nonprofiled majority group. Research participants given a task involving extremely difficult anagrams were given the opportunity to cheat. White participants randomly assigned to a condition in which two Black confederates were obtrusively singled out for scrutiny by the study administrator cheated more than Whites in a White-profiling condition and a no-profiling control condition, and more than Black participants in all three conditions. Black participants cheated at comparable levels across the three experimental conditions. The effect of the profiling of Blacks was consequently a net increase in cheating. The results indicate that racial profiling may be counterproductive. Download a PDF (177KB) The Indefensible Problems with RacialProfiling Martin, K.D., & Glaser, J. (2012).

(2009). The existence of implicit bias is beyond reasonable doubt: A refutation of ideological and methodological objections and executive summary of ten studies that no manager should ignore. Research in Organizational Behavior, 29 ,39-69. Abstract In this article, we respond at length to recent critiques of research on implicit bias, especially studies using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Tetlock and Mitchell (2009) claim that ‘‘there is no evidence that the IAT reliably predicts class-wide discrimination on tangible outcomes in any setting,’’ accuse their colleagues of violating ‘‘the injunction to separate factual from value judgments,’’ adhering blindly to a ‘‘statist interventionist’’ ideology, and of conducting a witch-hunt against implicit racists, sexists, and others. These and other charges are specious. Far from making ‘‘extraordinary claims’’ that ‘‘require extraordinary evidence,’’ researchers have identiﬁed the existence and consequences of implicit bias through well-established methods based upon principles of cognitive psychology that have been developed in nearly a century’s worth of work. We challenge the blanket skepticism and organizational complacency advocated by Tetlock and Mitchell and summarize 10 recent studies that no manager (or managerial researcher) should ignore. These studies reveal that students, nurses, doctors, police ofﬁcers, employment recruiters, and many others exhibit implicit biases with respect to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, social status, and other distinctions. Furthermore—and contrary to the emphatic assertions of the critics—participants’ implicit associations do predict socially and organizationally signiﬁcant behaviors, including employment, medical, and voting decisions made by working adults. # 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44 ,164-172. Abstract This research examines whether spontaneous, unintentional discriminatory behavior can be moderated by an implicit (nonconscious) motivation to control prejudice. We operationalize implicit motivation to control prejudice (IMCP) in terms of an implicit negative attitude toward prejudice (NAP) and an implicit belief that oneself is prejudiced (BOP). In the present experiment, an implicit stereotypic association of Blacks (vs. Whites) with weapons was positively correlated with the tendency to “shoot” armed Black men faster than armed White men (the “Shooter Bias”) in a computer simulation. However, participants relatively high in implicit negative attitude toward prejudice showed no relation between the race-weapons stereotype and the shooter bias. Implicit belief that oneself is prejudiced had no direct eVect on this relation, but the interaction of NAP and BOP did. Participants who had a strong association between self and prejudice (high BOP) but a weak association between prejudice and bad (low NAP) showed the strongest relation between the implicit race-weapons stereotype and the Shooter Bias, suggesting that these individuals freely employed their stereotypes in their behavior.

Implicit motivation to control prejudice moderates the effect of cognitive depletion on unintended discrimination. Social Cognition, 26,379-398. Abstract The role of Implicit motivation to Control prejudice (ImCp) in moderating the effect of resource depletion on spontaneous discriminatory behavior was examined. Cognitive resource depletion was manipulated by having participants solve either difficult or easy anagrams. A “Shooter Task” measuring unintended racial discriminatory behavior followed. participants then reported their subjective experiences in the task. Finally, ImCp and an implicit race-weapons stereotype were measured, both using Go/no-go Association Tasks (GnATs). ImCp moderated the effect of depletion on discriminatory behavior: depletion resulted in more racial bias in the Shooter Task only for those who scored low in our measure of ImCp, while high ImCp participants performed comparably in both the low and high depletion conditions.

Psychological Bulletin , 129,339-375. Abstract Analyzing political conservatism as motivated social cognition integrates theories of personality (authoritarianism, dogmatism–intolerance of ambiguity), epistemic and existential needs (for closure, regulatory focus, terror management), and ideological rationalization (social dominance, system justification). A meta-analysis (88 samples, 12 countries, 22,818 cases) confirms that several psychological variables predict political conservatism: death anxiety (weighted mean r  .50); system instability (.47); dogmatism–intolerance of ambiguity (.34); openness to experience (–.32); uncertainty tolerance (–.27); needs for order, structure, and closure (.26); integrative complexity (–.20); fear of threat and loss (.18); and self-esteem (–.09). The core ideology of conservatism stresses resistance to change and justification of inequality and is motivated by needs that vary situationally and dispositionally to manage uncertainty and threat.

Studying hate crime with the Internet: What makes racists advocate racial violence. Journal of Social Issues , 58,177-193. Abstract We conducted semistructured interviews with 38 participants in White racist Internet chat rooms, examining the extent to which people would, in this unique environment, advocate interracial violence in response to purported economic and cultural threats. Capitalizing on the anonymity and candor of chat room interactions, this study provides an unusual perspective on extremist attitudes. We experimentally manipulated the nature and proximity of the threats. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that the respondents were most threatened by interracial marriage and, to a lesser extent, Blacks moving into White neighborhoods. In contrast, job competition posed by Blacks evoked very little advocacy of violence. The study affords an assessment of the advantages and limitations of Internet-based research with clandestine populations.

       " 'Daniel S. Rokhsar': 'Daniel S. Rokhsar Contact Info Professor of Genetics, Genomics and Development Full Directory Information Research Interests My research is focused on understanding the origin, evolution, and diversity of animals (and, more generally, other groups of eukaryotes) by combining computational genome analysis with comparative developmental biology. Current Projects Comparative analysis of genomic diversity across animals and their relatives. The first signs of animal life appear in the fossil record ~600 million years ago. Modern survivors of these early progenitors include sponges, placozoans, cnidarians (anemones, jellyfish, hydra), ctenophores (comb jellies), and bilaterally symmetric animals (flies, snails, worms, humans). Each of these modern phyla retains some of the genomic dowry inherited from the early animals, elaborated on (and sometimes overwritten by) subsequent evolutionary innovations (and losses). By comparing genomes, we not only characterize the basic biochemical, physiological, and developmental “tool kits” of animals, but also map out their evolutionary history, and infer evolutionary mechanisms for the emergence of animal diversity complexity from more humble unicellular beginnings. Surprisingly, we are finding evidence for deep conservation of exon-intron gene structure, gene content and even chromosomal linkages and are using these features to try to reconstruct aspects of ancestral animal genomes. Evolution of nervous systems and animal behavior. The nervous system is a characteristic feature of eumetazoans (animals other than sponges), and presumably arose early in animal evolution from pre-existing pathways for regulated secretion and control of membrane potential. Although living cnidarians are often considered to have a simple “nerve net” with neurons but no complex patterns of neural connectivity, analysis of the sea anemone genome reveals a relatively complex “neural genome” with highly elaborated gene sets for neurotransmitter metabolism, regulated secretion, control of membrane potential, and other hallmarks of neurons in “higher” organisms. These genes are expressed in non-trivial patterns, suggesting that the apparently featureless “nerve net” of sea anemones has cryptic complexity. Even more remarkably, the apparently neuron-less placozoan Trichoplax has most of the genetic machinery to make neurons, but no recognizable neuronal cell type based on morphology. Through analysis of these systems and available genomes, we expect to uncover the core neural gene sets and networks that underlie the diversity of neural organizations in eumetazoa. Molecular analysis of spiralian development and evolution. Molluscs andannelids represent two diverse animal phyla that are united (along with several other groups of unsegmented worms) within the superphylum Spiralia, sharing spiral cleavage patterns early in development that give rise to a primitively free-living larval form, the trochophore. This ancient and widespread developmental pattern has been conservedat least since the early Cambrian -- over540 million years – and we can infer that animals resembling the modern trochopore in structure and development existed in these ancient seas. We are developing the owl limpet as a genome-enabled model system for the molecular study of spiralian development. This genome serves as a platform for the study of more far-flung molluscan groups, including the octopus and squid, which evolved neural complexity independently of vertebrates.

Interactions between cognitive, emotional and biological processes. whatshot Research Description We are interested in transdiagnostic approaches to treatment development, behavior change, sleep and comorbidity across adolescence and into adulthood. 1. Treatment Development and Behavior Change Although an evidence-based treatment for most types of mental illness has been developed, there is substantial room for improvement. The effect sizes of most available treatments are small to moderate, gains may not persist, and there are too many patients who derive little or no benefit. Even under optimal conditions, treatment failure is alarmingly common. Traditionally the development of psychological treatments has involved consensus between groups of skilled clinician researchers and many medication treatments have been discovered by serendipity. Hence, there have been calls for 'increased attention to science' in the treatment development process (Aronson, 2005; Insel, 2009; Salkovskis, 2002). We have a 15-year track record in treatment development research. We are currently running NIH-funded treatment research: for teens with depression and insomnia; teens with an anxiety disorder and a sleep problem; teens who are owls (go to bed late and wake late); adults with bipolar disorder and sleep disturbance; adults with severe mental illness and adults with chronic insomnia. Our collaborators include Dan Buysse (Pittsburgh), Greg Clarke (Kaiser, Oregon), Terence Ketter (Stanford), Descartes Li (UCSF), Rachel Loewy (UCSF), Charles Morin (University Laval, Quebec), Tom Neylan (UCSF) and Emily Ozer (UC Berkeley). Our approach to treatment development is to use a multi-systems and mechanisms-focused framework in which (a) cognitive, affective, biological, behavioral and developmental contributors are emphasized as the source for deriving novel interventions and (b) intervention research is used to develop hypotheses about and/or confirm mechanisms. Most of the treatments we have developed focus on sleep, diet, excercise and emotion regulation. As such, we have a deep interest in the growing science of behavior change. https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange/overview 2. Sleep and Comorbidity Another focus is the ever fascinating topic of SLEEP. Humans spend one-third of their lives sleeping. Yet there are still so many puzzles that remain to be solved about why humans sleep. It is a very exciting time to be studying sleep because it is a relatively young science; much has been learned but much remains to be discovered. The aims of our current research program are briefly described below. Chronic Insomnia a) We are interested in uncovering the processes that contribute to the cause and/or maintenance of chronic insomnia. In particular we are interested in the interaction between cognitive processes (e.g., worry/ rumination, attention, memory, reasoning), emotional processes (measured by psychophysiology, FACS coding, subjective ratings) and biological processes (measured by EEG, DLMO, and analysis of DNA). b) We have completed an NIMH-funded randomized controlled trial comparing three psychological treatments for chronic insomnia. This was a two-site study conducted in collaboration with Dr. Charles Morin at the University of Laval. c) Most prior research on insomnia has focused on nighttime factors. We are pursuing the hypothesis that insomnia is a 24-hour disorder and that the daytime processes are just as important as the nighttime processes. d) We collaborate with Matthew Walker's lab on studies that include detailed analyses of the sleep EEG of insomnia patients as well as the impact of insomnia on daytime processing of emotions.

Sleep disturbance across other psychiatric disorders: A transdiagnostic approach Our team was an early contributor to discussions on transdiagnostic approaches (Harvey et al., 2004). A transdiagnostic process is defined as a process that is in common across more than one mental illness. Also, we have highlighted sleep and circadian dysfunction as a biologically and theoretically plausible transdiagnostic contributor to severe mental illness and proposed a transdiagnostic treatment for sleep and circadian disturbance. The latter is currently being empirically evaluated in two new studies. The rationale is that prior treatment studies have been disorder-focused—they have treated a specific sleep problem (e.g., insomnia) in a specific diagnostic group (e.g., depression). However, real life sleep and circadian problems are not so neatly categorized, particularly in severe mental illness where features of insomnia overlap with hypersomnia, delayed sleep phase and irregular sleep-wake schedules. One hypothesis we are testing is whether the Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) will improve functional impairment, disorder-focused symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning. We will recruit participants across DSM diagnoses and across common sleep and circadian problems. Given the data that the elements of TranS-C are efficacious across diagnoses in research settings with research-based providers, the next step is to test TranS-C in community settings with community-based providers. Accordingly, we are conducting an ‘efficacy in the real world’ RCT within Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBHCS). In Behavior Research and Therapy we have published our motivation for conducting this research in community settings, including the 15-20 year gap between treatment development and dissemination (Harvey & Gumport, 2015).

Evidence-based psychological treatments for mental disorders: Modifiable barriers to access and possible solutions. Behavior Research and Therapy, 68, 1-15. 3. Memory Support This line of research arises from a long-term interest in memory and cognitive science. The specific idea was triggered by our clinical observation that patient memory for treatment can be poor. We were concerned that poor memory for treatment may contribute to poorer outcome. Consistent with these observations, we empirically established that memory for treatment is poor and that better recall for treatment is associated with better outcome. We also developed an intervention designed to improve memory for treatment. Distilled from the cognitive science and education literatures and based on carefully honed criteria, the Memory Support Intervention is comprised of eight powerful memory promoting strategies. Although this new intervention—the Memory Support Intervention—has potential to be added to a broad range of treatment types, such as psychosocial treatments and physician visits for medication management (‘ pantreatment ’) for a broad range of mental and physical disorders (‘ transdiagnostic ’), we are focusing on major depressive disorder (MDD) and cognitive therapy (CT) to create a ‘platform’ for the next step in investigating this approach.

Sleep in Adolescence We completed a comparison of two treatments for sleep problems in depressed youth (n = 48). Half of the sample was collected by our team here at UC Berkeley. The other half was collected at Kaiser, Oregon by Dr. Greg Clarke’s team. The rationale for the study was that psychological and pharmacological treatments for youth depression yield response and remission rates that are modest at best. Improving these outcomes was our primary goal. Toward that end, we developed and tested a youth cognitive behavioral insomnia intervention, to be employed as an adjunct to depression-focused treatments. Our rationale for this seemingly indirect route to improving youth depression treatment outcomes is based on epidemiology findings regarding the risk of depression imparted by primary insomnia and an initial adult depression randomized controlled trial suggesting that joint treatment of insomnia along with more traditional depression-focused treatments may yield significantly better depression outcomes—with the added benefit of improved sleep. However, progress in this line of research has been impeded by the lack of a well-tested, developmentally-appropriate treatment for sleep disordered youth who are also depressed. Therefore, we employed an iterative drafting and revision process, utilizing basic science findings, to develop a youth CBT insomnia intervention. We then conducted a pilot feasibility RCT of the final youth insomnia CBT intervention with depressed youth who also meet criteria for insomnia. Consistent with the hypothesis, the results indicated that treating both sleep and depression in an inter-woven fashion (addressing both in each session) improved sleep and reduced depression, relative to a sleep hygiene control. The paper reporting these results is published in Behavior Research and Therapy. Two other studies were seeded by the Teen Depression Study. First, insomnia is only one of the types of sleep disturbances experienced by depressed youth. Also, depression is only one type of health problem experienced during the adolescent years. Accordingly, funded by NICHD, we developed a treatment that is ‘transdiagnostic’ in that it targets the broader range of sleep disturbance experienced by teens and it is designed to help a broader range of teens who experience sleep disturbances (not just depressed teens). The description of the treatment is published in Cognitive and Behavioral Practice . Second, supported by an NIDA funded R34 Co-PIed with Dr. Emily Ozer, we are exploring whether it is possible to reach more youth in school/classroom settings. This study addresses our frustration that one-to-one 50 minute treatment sessions is unlikely to be cost effective nor scaleable. Classrooms and a primary prevention strategy may make a larger public health impact. To read more take a look at: Harvey, A. G. (in press).

Your current research focuses on business administration and management.  What do you see as the greatest management challenges in the information arena? I am a management scholar who happens to have a strong interest in information. The hallmark of today’s management is decentralization, which also means that information is widely dispersed. The key challenge is to assimilate disparate pieces of information so that work can be done better. In your class \"Managing Information-Intensive Companies\", you discuss management principles for the Information Economy.  Can you give us one example of an management skill that is too-often overlooked? Collaboration. We know a lot about managing in a hierarchy, but we know much less about how to manage across many parts. <a class=\"addthis_button_facebook\" title=\"Facebook\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_twitter\" title=\"Twitter\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_google_plusone_share\" title=\"Google+\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_linkedin\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_email\" title=\"Email\"></a> People Faculty Staff Students Visitors Alumni Incoming Students How to reach me Office: 305B South Hall Telephone: (510) 642-8726 Email: hansen@ischool.berkeley.edu Twitter: @MortenTHansen Website Recent courses taught Fall 2016 Info 225.

       " 'Charles B. Harris': \"Professor of the Graduate School Professor Emeritus email: cbharris@berkeley.edu office: D87 Hildebrand phone: 510.642.2814 fax: 510.642.6724 Research Group Recent Publications Research Interests Physical Chemistry Theoretical Chemistry Chemical Dynamics Surface Science — Femtosecond lasers in the visible and infrared are used to study energy transfer, relaxation, and primary processes in chemical reactions in liquids and the dynamical properties of electrons at interfaces and surfaces on ultrafast timescales. Research projects going on in the group are two-fold. They include the study of the statistical or dynamical basis of chemical reactions in condensed phase on the femtosecond time scale and the dynamics and properties of electrons on surfaces and at interfaces. Femtosecond lasers and ultrahigh vacuum technology provide a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of electrons at metal-dielectric and metal-semiconductor interfaces. The femtosecond two-photon photoemission (TPPE) technique utilizes a femtosecond pump pulse to excite electrons from the metal substrate into states associated with the surface. Photoemission of the surface electrons with a second femtosecond pulse allows one to follow the various surface properties in real time since the photoemission intensity as a function of time delay between the pump and the probe pulse directly reveals the dynamics of the surface electron population. Layer-by-layer growth of dielectrics and large band gap semiconductors on metal surfaces influences the binding energies, lifetimes, and spatial distributions of electrons on surfaces and at interfaces. Studies of Xe overlayers have shown the evolution of metal surface states into quantum well states. Overlayers of n-alkanes result in self-trapping of initially delocalized electrons into localized small polarons. We have studied two dimensional solvation of electrons interacting with nitrile and alcohol overlayers on silver surfaces. Current studies focus on extending our understanding of electronic structure and dynamics to technologically important systems. In general these methods enable us to study the dynamics of electrons interacting with condensed matter in 2-D and how the properties change as the system evolves into 3-D. The second area, femtosecond infrared and ultraviolet and visible spectroscopic methods are utilized to investigate the dynamics of complex chemical reactions in solution. The most basic reactions in solution share certain reaction processes, which include dissociation, recombination, solvent caging, molecular morphology changes, and system-solvent interaction. These molecular events, which underlie our basic understanding of reaction dynamics, occur on ultrafast (10-13-10-10 s) timescales. Our research utilizes femtosecond experimental techniques along with modern computational methods to study these fundamental issues. The femtosecond infrared lasers developed in our group enable us to study a variety of chemical systems in both the time and spectral domain and as such we can follow elementary chemical reaction events as they occur. There are also workstations capable of carrying out large-scale, high-level quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Theoretical methods including ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) as well as MD are utilized to assist interpretation and realization of experimental results. The combined experimental and theoretical approach leads to a deeper understanding of these fundamental processes. Not only do the results of these studies address the issues outlined above, but they are also of interest to researchers throughout the many subdisciplines in chemistry including biological, organometallic, inorganic, and organic chemistry. In many instances the theoretical basis for the experiments and observations must also be developed. As a result graduate students from Professor Harris's group often obtain their Ph.D. with a strong background in both theory and experiment. Biography Professor, born 1940; B.S.

       " 'Roddy Creedon': 'Roddy  Creedon Continuing Lecturer in Architecture Education M.Arch., Harvard Graduate School of Design B.Arch., Tulane University Intermediate School, The Architectural Association Philosophy Statement The sensibilities that underlie my work attempt to acknowledge that we operate in times of competing cultural, ecological and architectural circumstances, that we do best when we strive for an architecture that addresses disparate realms of consideration, and that this implied mediation is a rich source of content for how one can position the making of things in the world. I believe in the possibility of an intensely beneficial reciprocity between the worlds of learning and practice, worlds often positioned at odds with each other to the detriment of both. I know I am better at both for my commitment to each, and I believe it is in straddling these worlds that thought can best inform action. Biography Roddy Creedon is the principal of Allied Architecture and Design. The work of Allied has received numerous citations for excellence in design, and has been broadly published in both books and journals. The work of the office tends towards two distinct, but related bodies of investigation. The first body of work centers around buildings, and specifically, upon a conviction that architecture relies upon a refined sense of material development for the best elucidation of its ideas. A second body of work concerns the internal life of architecture, and often involves a more extensive design of complete environments. The collective interests these bodies of work map out provides the office a terrain for exploring architecture from its most abstract to its most tactile, from the realm of ideas to the world of material poetics.

The formal strategies we employ address the world idealized; the informal strategies address the world as we find it. The vernacular is our source of inspiration for adaptive informal strategies. It is the street language of architecture. It rewrites formal intentions to adapt to immediate circumstances. Circumstantial architecture alternatively accepts and manipulates the chance conditions that define the architectural situation. We begin each design with a formal strategy that we in turn \"remodel\", conceptually, to adapt to the givens of the site and client. Our aesthetic is circumstantial and our method improvisational.

Books: American Identity and the Politics of Multiculturalism (2014) Co-authored with David Sears.This book uses public opinion data to illuminate Americans’ conceptions of national identity in the aftermath of the civil rights movement and massive change in the ethnic composition of the county due to immigration reform. It considers the degree of public support for different formulas for coping with diversity, most notably the ideology of multiculturalism. It reviews patterns of ethnic consensus and conflict with particular attention to the exceptionism of African-Americans and the evidence of assimilation of Lationand Asian immigrants to America. Public Opinion and Constitutional Controversy (2009) Co-edited with Nathaniel Persily and Patrick Egan.This book provides a comprehensive analysis of American public opinion on the key constitutional controversies of the twentieth centuries. It examines the reciprocal influences of public opinion and Supreme Court decisions over time. The chapters challenge the belief that Supreme Court decisions invariable and powerfully influence public opinion. Nominating the President: Evolution and Revolution in 2008 and Beyond (2009) Co-edited with David Karol. The 2008 presidential nominations were unprecedented in many ways, with ongoing democratization of the selection process and a surprising loss of control by party elites. This book assesses the impact of changes in the nomination process with original research about money, scheduling, superdelegates, and the role of race and gender in voting. Tax Revolt: Something for Nothing in California (1982, 1985) Co-Authored with David Sears.This book is an in-depth study of a notable taxpayers' rebellion: Howard Jarvis and Proposition 13, the Gann measure of 1979, and Proposition 9 (Jarvis 11) of 1980. The authors consider a variety of partial explanations: the self-interest of certain groups, the apathy of others, the role of party affiliation, the specter of symbolic racism, the meaning of mass mood surges. They also include a new preface and a new chapter reviewing the consequences of the revolt and the responses to the fiscal stress. Articles: J. Citrin, A. Lerman, M. Murakami, and K.

       " 'Ozlem Ayduk': \"Professor Email Address: ayduk@berkeley.edu Office: 3411 Tolman Hall Education: Ph.D., Columbia University Research Area: Social-Personality Laboratory: Relationships and Social Cognition Lab Research Interests: Close relationships; emotion regulation; development of self-regulation in children whatshot Research Description My research interests fall into three related but distinct domains. One is concerned with the role of negative interpersonal schemas as a social-cognitive mediator of personal and interpersonal adjustment. The second one focuses on the role of self-distancing in enabling emotional regulation. The third one examines the precursors, correlates and the consequences of children’s ability to delay gratification. Social-cognitive mediators of interpersonal adjustment Although rejection by significant others elicits a wide range of psychological problems including depression, low self-esteem, and intimate violence, not everybody who faces rejection experiences these negative outcomes to the same extent. So how can we explain such variability in how effectively people cope with rejection? Most of my earlier research focused on individual differences in Rejection Sensitivity (RS) -- a personality disposition that develops out of early experiences of rejection, and is characterized by heightened fears and expectations of rejection. In a nutshell, this work demonstrates that rejection sensitivity is associated with negative overreactions to perceived rejection (anger/hostility, or depression), with relationship difficulties (breakups, borderline personality features), and with problems in the self-concept (reduced self-concept clarity). In related work, we have shown, however that the link between rejection and maladjustment is moderated by self-regulatory competencies particularly for people who have negative interpersonal schemas, such those high in RS or low in self-esteem. Using various measures of self-regulation at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., attentional control, behavioral measures of delay of gratification, physiological measures such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia and brain activity), these findings indicate that people are at lower risk for responding to rejection maladaptively to the extent that they are good self-regulators. In current work, we are focusing on two new questions. In one line of work, my students and I are examining whether rejection also elicits self-directed hostility and harm in people who are high in RS (e.g., self-cutting, binge eating). In another line of work, we are examining whether interpersonally vulnerable individuals (e.g., high RS or low self-esteem) process positive, acceptance-related information in a biased fashion (e.g., do vulnerable individuals forget acceptance feedback faster?). Self-distancing and emotion regulation In this domain, my efforts have focused on empirically distinguishing adaptive from maladaptive forms of self-reflection in collaborative work with Dr. Ethan Kross. A fundamental assumption in theory, research, and clinical practice on emotion regulation is that it is helpful to process and work-through experiences that heighten negative affect. However, efforts to constructively analyze one’s emotions can easily be undermined as individuals find themselves entangled in rumination that further increases negative affect. Therefore, the question we are trying to address is: how can individuals think about negative past experiences in a way that allows them to change their underlying representation so that the experience is no longer a source of distress yet do so without falling into rumination or reverting to avoidance en route? In an attempt to address this question, our research has shown that whether individuals experience heightened reactivity (in the form of negative affect, physiological arousal, accessibility of negative thoughts or rumination) in response to negative autobiographical experiences, depends on the self-perspective from which they attempt to reflect on their reactions. More specifically, these studies show that focusing on negative experiences from a self-distanced, 3rd person perspective compared to a self-immersed, 1st person perspective attenuates subjective experiences of emotional reactivity. Moreover, these beneficial effects on reactivity persist over time. These findings hold regardless of whether self-distanced perspective is situationally induced in experimental studies or is spontaneously used in individual difference studies. Self-distanced analysis is more effective in down-regulating negative affect than self-immersed analysis partly because it attenuates people’s tendency to simply recount what happened to them, while facilitating attempts to reconstrue the meaning of their experience as revealed by content analysis of their narratives. Many questions remain unanswered in this program of research that we are pursuing in ongoing work. Of specific importance is to test the utility of the self-distanced perspective in clinical populations (e.g., people with depression or PTSD) to assess its boundary conditions. Furthermore, our research to date has focused exclusively on coping with negative emotions related to past experiences. Therefore, our current work has begun examining the implications of self-distancing for coping with negative experiences as they unfold in vivo, for example, when one is arguing with a significant other, or is facing a stressful performance situation. A related project is exploring the usefulness of self-distancing for down-regulating worry about future anticipated negative events. Finally, we are also investigating the link between self-distancing and resource depletion asking whether distancing takes a hidden toll on individuals because of its more effortful nature. Delay of gratification in children In collaboration with Walter Mischel, I also study the developmental precursors and long-term consequences of the ability to delay gratification in children For example, in past work, we have shown that sensitive parenting is an important precursor to the development of this competency in children. Our work has also documented that early delay ability in children predict a wide range of positive outcomes later in life, including better cognitive control in adolescence, and social-cognitive competencies in adulthood. As outlined above, we have also documented that delay of gratification ability serves as buffer against interpersonal vulnerabilities. In current collaborative work, we are focusing on understanding the cognitive and neural basis of divergent developmental trajectories in delay of gratification. In one study, we are working with a group of participants who have completed the delay task when they were in preschool more than 40 years ago. Our goal is to probe whether differences in inhibitory control, working memory, or ability to suppress unwanted information explain the differences between good and poor self-regulators. Additionally, we are exploring the neural correlates of performance differences in these three domains of cognitive control in an fMRI study. In a second study, we are working with 6 to 8 year children and running them through the delay of gratification task in an fMRI study to more directly examine the neural networks that may support this important competency. place Selected Publications Mendoza-Denton, R. & Ayduk, O.

       " 'David Zusman': 'David Zusman Contact Info Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/zusman/ Full Directory Information Research Interests The focus of our research has been to determine how signal transduction regulates directed motility and behavior in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus using an integrated approach that combines biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology. M. xanthus is an excellent model system to address fundamental questions concerning cell-cell signaling and directed movement as cells form multicellular biofilms and fruiting bodies as part of a complex life cycle. Previously, we have shown that the Frz signal transduction pathway regulates both vegetative swarming and developmental aggregation by controlling the reversal frequency of cells. We hypothesized that M. xanthus , like E. coli and other chemotaxing bacteria, control directional movements by temporal sensing of stimuli and biasing directional motility. We remained focused on the Frz system since it is probably the master regulator of directional control in this organism. This pathway has multiple inputs and multiple outputs, which are all coordinated. We were trying to understand the nature of these input and output signals, their regulation and how they control the two engines of gliding motility. Current Projects In the last few years we have been studying the motor proteins that power gliding motility in M. xanthus . The motor proteins interact with the Frz chemosensory system and with MreB, an actin homolog. The Frz system regulates cell polarity through MglA, a Ras family GTPase. We examined the localization and dynamics of MglA and the gliding motors in high spatial and time resolution. We determined that MglA localizes not only at the cell poles, but also along the cell bodies, forming a decreasing concentration gradient toward the lagging cell pole. MglA directly interacts with the motor protein AglR, and the spatial distribution of AglR reversals is positively correlated with the MglA gradient. Thus, the motors moving toward lagging cell poles are less likely to reverse, generating stronger forward propulsion.

       " 'Reinhard Genzel': 'Research Area(s): Astrophysics Biography Reinhard Genzel received his Ph.D. from the University of Bonn (FRG) in 1978. He came to Berkeley as a Miller Fellow in 1980 and joined the Physics Department faculty as Associate Professor in 1981. He left Berkeley in 1986 to become Director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich (FRG) where he is also Honorary Professor at the Ludwig-Maximilian University. In 1999 he came back to UCB as part-time Professor. Awards and Honors include the Otto Hahn Medal of the Max Planck Society (1979), Presidential Investigator Award (1983), Newton Lacy Pierce Prize of the American Astronomical Society (1986), Leibniz Prize of the German Science Foundation (1990), Foreign Member of the Academie des Sciences (France, 1998), Lyman Spitzer Lecturer (Princeton, 1998), Sackler Lecturer 2000 (Princeton University), Oort Professor 2000 (Leiden University), de Vaucouleurs Medal 2000 (University of Texas, Austin), Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences (2000) and Prix Janssen (2001). Research Interests My research interests are in experimental astrophysics. My research group and I are studying the physical processes and the evolution of active galaxies and in particular of their central regions. One key issue we have been pursuing is the question whether the accretion onto massive black holes, or star formation powers active and luminous galaxies. For instance, in one class of very luminous galaxies we were recently able to demonstrate from mid-infrared spectroscopy on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) that enormous bursts of star formation triggered by the collision of galaxies can produce quasar-like luminosities in the infrared. Such galaxies were apparently much more common in the past than in the local Universe. We are also engaged in testing the paradigm that active galactic nuclei indeed all contain massive black holes. In the nucleus of our own Galaxy we were able to show from near-infrared imaging observations of the motions of individual stars in the central few light days that there must be a million solar mass, central black hole. Such key science goals have been driving our experimental program. We have been developing novel instrumentation, mainly in the infrared and submillimeter range, for large ground-based, airborne and space telescopes. We have been developing sensitive infrared spectrometers and imagers across the entire 1-1000mm band. We are active in the area of adaptive optics with laser stars. Current Projects We want to push our studies to ever smaller spatial scales and to ever larger distances, reaching galaxies that were formed in the first few billion years after the Big Bang. Using the new generation of 10m class, ground based telescopes (such as the Keck telescope) together with the new techniques of adaptive optics and interferometry, near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy will be able in the next decade to zoom into the innermost cores of nearby active galaxies. Such high resolution techniques will reveal whether central black holes are present, how they are fed and whether/how stars are formed there. At larger distances it will be possible, for example, to study quantitatively the dynamics of colliding/merging galaxies. Mergers are a key process in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Finally the high resolution observations also make possible spatially resolved studies of the first galaxies formed at high redshift. In the next few years we are planning to carry out infrared observations on these subjects (on the Keck and the ESO VLT) on a broad front and in part with instruments that we are now building. We also will push the capability of far-infrared/submillimeter observations. We are engaged in building a sensitive far-infrared imaging spectrometer for the new SOFIA airborne observatory that will house a 2.5m telescope in a B747 aircraft. With SOFIA it will be possible to study the far-infrared emission of distant star forming galaxies and reveal their activity independent of the effects of dust obscuration that hampers or makes impossible measurements at shorter wavelengths. Sensitive astronomical measurements require state of the art radiation detectors. We have begun an ambitious program of developing Ga:As photoconductor detectors. Ga:As detectors promise to substantially extend the wavelength cutoff of present Ge detectors into the submillimeter band, and at the same time, they may be developed into monolithic, large pixel size formats. Our development aims at a blocked impurity band device that could be used on SOFIA or future space missions. Scientific Cooperations UCB-MPG Center for International Exchange in Astrophysics and Space Sciences The UCB-MPG Center for International Exchange in Astrophysics and Space Sciences (UCB-MPG Center) has been established in a close collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley (UCB, Berkeley, USA) at Berkeley. Its goal is cooperation in all fields of astrophysics, astronomy and space sciences. Exchange of scientists, visits and conferences are supplemented by joint projects like SOFIA and the detector development for the far-infrared. MPE is coordinating this project of seven Max-Planck institutes. In 2001, there were approximately thirty visits of Max Planck staff to UCB and vice versa under the auspices of the program.

Empirical studies include: (1) the phylogenetic relationships of the major groups of bryophytes (including mosses) and other land plants, using morphological, developmental, and ultrastructural characters as well as chloroplast DNA sequence data; (2) the development of moss peristomes in relation to evolution of the group; and (3) biosystematic studies of the haplolepideous mosses, including the tropical family Calymperaceae and the diverse temperate genus Tortula (Syntrichia), which involve transplant and ecological studies in the field, comparative physiological measurements and culture experiments in the lab, and morphological studies in the herbarium; (4) the reproductive biology of bryophytes, especially dryland mosses; and (5) the bryophyte floras of California, Moorea (in the Society Islands of the South Pacific), and Australia. Theoretical studies include investigations of the nature of species, rank-free classification, methods for phylogenetic reconstruction (with an emphasis on cladistic analysis of molecular and genomic data), the relationship between development and evolution, phyloinformatics (comparative genomics, databasing, and visualization of phylogenetic trees), and biodiversity informatics (digitization of biological collections and integration with taxonomic and ecological data). His lab applies methods ranging from microscopy through growth experiments, DNA sequencing, and comparative genomics. Selected Publications M. Benassi, L.R. Stark, J.C. Brinda, D.N. McLetchie, M.

In particular, Eric is interested in approximations that retain their accuracy even in systems where mean-field-based methods such as density functional theory and even coupled cluster theory are grossly incorrect due to the breakdown of the statistically independent particle approximation. Advances in this area are needed in order to improve our predictive power over chemical catalysis, molecular light harvesting, and materials with non-innocent d or f orbitals.

Research Aihwa Ong\\'s work has always dealt with the particular entanglements of politics, technology, and culture in rapidly changing situations on the Asia Pacific rim. Currently, her work focuses on regimes of governing, technology, and culture that crystallize new meanings and practices of the human. Her field research shifts between sites in Southeast Asia and China in order to track emerging global centers and biotechnical experiments in East Asian modernity. Profile As a foreign-born anthropologist, Aihwa Ong has always approached research from vantage points outside or athwart the United States. This angle of inquiry unsettles and troubles stabilized viewpoints and units of analysis in the social sciences. From her early work on Muslim factory women in Malaysia, to the experiences of migrant Chinese and Cambodian refugees in California; from the selective deployment of neoliberal norms to the rise of biotech projects in Asia, Ong explores how the interaction between global forms and situated politics and cultures shape emerging globalized contexts. Ong\\'s inter-disciplinary approach and her ideas -- \"flexible citizenship,\" \"graduated sovereignty,\" \"global assemblages,\" among others _ are featured in debates on globalization and modernity. She has lectured internationally and been invited to the World Economic Forum. Her awards include grants from the MacArthur Foundation and the National Science Foundation, and some book prizes. On campus, Ong is affiliated with the Blum Center for Developing Economies, Global Metropolitan Studies, Interdisciplinary Studies, Gender and Women\\'s Studies, and the Center for Southeast Asian Studies.

We focus on the epigenetic mechanism that regulates the flowering and seed development genes by the Polycomb Group (PcG) and trithorax Group (trxG) protein complexes. We also take a phylogenetic approach to study the origin and evolution of the PcG genes, as well as their function in early emerging plants. The long term goal is to understand their contribution in the evolution of plant development and generation of diverse morphology. Research Epigenetic regulation of plant development Research Research in the Sung laboratory is focused on the regulation of gene function at the chromatin level in plants. Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins play evolutionarily conserved roles in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The mutually antagonistic activities of PcG and trxG proteins promote the stable and maintenance of repressed and active transcriptional states, respectively, via histone modification on the target gene sequences. Despite the general view and advances in studies of the PcG and trxG proteins, we still know little about how PcG function relates to that of the trxG. We are studying a plant-specific gene, EMBRYONIC FLOWER 1 ( EMF1 ), encoding an transcriptional regulator involved in plant PcG-mediated gene repression mechanism. Genome-wide investigation of EMF1 targets showed that EMF1 regulates the expression of a large number of transcription factor genes, including flower and seed genes, via diverse mechanisms. Tissue-specific removal of EMF1 activity from leaf primordia leads to early flowering plants with curly leaves that can be counteracted by mutations in ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) . Thus ULT1 functions as a trxG factor antagonizing PcG action on flowering. ult1 mutation counteracting early flowering is accompanied by restoration of the reduced trimethylation of Histone3 lysine 27 on flower MADS box genes in the emf mutants. We are studying PcG and trxG functions and molecular mechanism of their activities. Recent studies revealed unexpected observation that contrary toPcG and trxG antagonistic action on flower genes, trxG can compensate the loss of EMF1 function in maintaining seed gene repression during germination. A current goal is to characterize this novel compensatory mechanism by the trxG factors and how they play opposite role in regulating seed development and flowering, two important traits in agriculture. Mutations in EMBRYONIC FLOWER genes cause Arabidopsis embryos to flower right after germination, producing miniature flowering plants, shown here on a penny for scale.

I also engage in comparative work on the grammars and lexicons of South American languages to shed light on the history of the indigenous societies of the continent. Methodologically, my work is grounded in language documentation and description, and historical and contact linguistics. The typologically remarkable nature of Amazonian languages has also led to an interest in language typology, while my involvement with indigenous communities, has led to a substantial engagement in community-oriented language pedagogy and revitalization activities.

This description was satisfactory inasmuch as the intricate pathways of metabolism and, later, the basic mechanisms of gene regulation and signal transduction were still being unraveled. Gradually, and in part as a result of the parallel growth in the structural understanding of the molecular components of the cell, together with the development of single molecule manipulation methods, scientists have become increasingly aware that the cell resembles more a mechanical factory in which many of the processes are performed by specialized machinery whose behavior is essentially mechanical in nature. Biochemical processes as diverse as the elastic response of DNA, protein-induced DNA bending, chromosomal segregation, replication, transcription, translation, protein translocation across membranes, catalyzed protein and nucleic acid folding and unfolding, and even the ubiquitous processes of induced-fit molecular recognition, are all examples in which forces and torques develop in molecules as they move along their reaction coordinates. They are thus, amenable of study by direct manipulation methods. Methods of single-molecule manipulation (such as optical tweezers or atomic force micrsocopy) are being used today to: a) measure directly the forces holding molecular structures together, b) determine the stresses and strains generated in the course of chemical and biochemical reactions, c) exert external forces or torques to alter the extent and fate of these reactions, and d) reveal the rules that govern the interconversion of mechanical and chemical forces in these processes. This area of research can be rightly called mechanochemistry. Single molecule methods are ideal to investigate the dynamics of complex reactions for, unlike their bulk counterparts, they make it possible to follow the trajectories of the individual molecules as they undergo their reactions in real-time, thus avoiding the ensemble average over the uncorrelated signals from a molecular population. We use single molecule manipulation methods to: Determine mechanical properties of macromolecules Characterize the forces that maintain and hold together the structure of proteins and RNA (folding studies); Characterize the mechanochemical energy conversion of nucleic-acid-binding molecular motors; Develop the theoretical framework for the analysis and the interpretation of single molecules data including how to extract equilibrium data from non-equilibrium measurements. Current Projects We are studying the structural basis of protein-DNA interactions and their relevance in the processes of control of gene expression using single molecule manipulation methods. In prokaryotes, and specially in eukaryotes, replication and transcription regulation involve the interaction of many specialized protein factors at regulator locations on the sequence to insure correct sequence recognition, initiation, processivity, fidelity, and kinetic control. We wish to understand the multiple structural, spatial, and functional relationships among these regulatory factors. Our laboratory is also working actively in the development of methods of single-molecule manipulation, including the use of SFM cantilevers, optical tweezers, and magnetic tweezers to investigate the mechanical properties of macromolecules. Recently, for example, we used force-measuring optical tweezers to induce complete mechanical unfolding and refolding of individual Escherichia coli ribonuclease H (RNase H) molecules. The protein unfolds in a two-state manner and refolds through an intermediate that correlates with the transient molten globule–like interme- diate observed in bulk studies. This intermediate displays unusual mechanical compliance and unfolds at substantially lower forces than the native state. In a narrow range of forces, the molecule hops between the unfolded and intermediate states in real time. Occasionally, hopping was observed to stop as the molecule crossed the folding barrier directly from the intermediate, demonstrating that the intermediate is on-pathway. These studies allow us to map the energy landscape of RNase H, which represents the most complete description of the folded state of the protein. In the case of RNA, we have found conditions under which it is possible to unfold the molecules at equilibrium. In this case, it is possible to extract directly both the thermodynamics and kinetics of unfolding. Novel statistical mechanical methods are also being implemented to extract thermodynamics information from non-equilibrium data when the unfolding process does not occur reversibly. Finally, we are also studying DNA-binding molecular motors (nucleic acid translocases such as RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase, etc.) using optical tweezers to investigate the dynamics of these molecules and their mechanochemical conversion during translocation, as well as the effect of external force load and nucleotide tri-phosphate concentration on their power and force generation. A molecular motor of special interest is the bacteriophage phi 29 connector, which is responsible, together with its associated ATPase (gp16) for the packaging of the viral DNA inside the capsid during bacteriophage assembly. Our single molecule studies have revealed that this is powerful motor, capable of generating forces as high as 57 pN.

       " 'Lance Kriegsfeld': 'Professor Email Address: kriegsfeld@berkeley.edu Office: 3139 Tolman Hall Education: Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University Research Area: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience Laboratory: Kriegsfeld Lab Curriculum Vitae: lkriegsfeld_cv.pdf Research Interests: Behavioral neuroendocrinology, circadian biology, reproductive behavior and physiology, seasonality/photoperiodism, behavioral genetics, behavioral neuroscience whatshot Research Description The broad goal of the research in our laboratory is to understand the genetic, cellular, and hormonal mechanisms responsible for the temporal control of motivated behaviors and their underlying physiology. We are particularly interested in the mechanisms by which the circadian system coordinates myriad neural and peripheral processes to maintain homeostasis and promote optimal psychological and physiological functioning. Circadian rhythms in mammals are endogenously generated by a brain clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus. These behavioral and physiological rhythms persist in the absence of environmental time cues with exquisite precision. For this line of research, we are interested in two general research questions: 1) What are the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which circadian rhythms are generated by the mammalian brain clock? 2) How does the SCN communicate timing information to the rest of the brain and body? These lines of research examine the circadian control of endocrine function as a model system. The endocrine system provides an ideal opportunity to investigate the mechanisms and pathways by which the SCN exerts control over peripheral physiology and behavior. The cells in the brain that regulate endocrine function have been well characterized and there are abundant data available on the mechanisms by which the neuroendocrine axis is controlled hierarchically. Combined, these pieces of information allow for discovering general principles of circadian regulation of behavioral and physiological functioning using a tractable system. Our laboratory is also interested in investigations of timing on a yearly schedule. In order to cope with the energetic challenges of winter, species inhabiting nontropical and boreal latitudes inhibit reproduction and other energetically costly processes. Inhibition of reproduction occurs in anticipation of winter in response to decreasing day lengths. Day length information is transmitted by the retina, interpreted by the SCN, and communicated to the pineal gland. The duration of pineal melatonin secretion codes day length and drives seasonal changes in reproduction. However, the neural pathways on which melatonin acts to inhibit reproduction remain elusive. Theoretically, melatonin should communicate either directly or indirectly to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal system to regulate seasonal changes in reproduction. Our lab is currently investigating the role of a novel inhibitory RFamide peptide whose neurons project to the GnRH system and are in a key position to modulate seasonal changes in reproduction. Graduate students will typically work on the above subject matter but are encouraged to develop their own individual lines of investigation that fit within the general goals of the laboratory. Active collaborations within the psychology department and with other laboratories in the neurosciences are encouraged. place Selected Publications Kriegsfeld, L.J., Silver, R., Gore, A.C., & Crews, D (2002).

       " 'Jenna Burrell': 'Jenna Burrell Associate Professor Focus technology appropriation in non-Western societies, technology and socio-economic development, qualitative research methods Research areas Computer-mediated Communication Social & Cultural Studies Technology for Developing Regions User Experience Research Biography Current Research I study the impact of large-scale technology diffusion on individuals, families, and societies in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world. I employ a ground-level perspective on such trends spending time with African technology users (and sometimes non-users) to capture a rich, local commentary on technology and development issues. I explore alternate notions of \\'development\\' and evaluate how social and cultural dimensions of everyday life impact the appropriation of technology and shape who has access to it. What is the best thing about working at the I School? There are so many directions you can take your research interests here, given the interdisciplinary nature of the school. It\\'s great to be able to do social critique and theoretical work, but also to think about and influence technology design as well. It\\'s also fantastic to be located in the Bay Area. What Information issues interest you most? What are the origins of the term \\'information\\' as we understand it? How is this very abstract concept understood in different societies and in different languages? Your background is in Sociology and Computer Science; how did you become interested in technology appropriation in developing societies? I was working for a couple of years with a group of social scientists at Intel. Members of the group were doing some profoundly innovative work in Europe and Latin America, thinking about new markets and new design ideas to challenge the US-centric tendencies in the industry. My interest in the developing world evolved pretty slowly out of a more general interest in technology practices in \\'non-Western\\' societies. When I started my thesis research on Internet café use in Accra, Ghana my intent was not to study these users as people in need of \\'development.\\' I went in to explore the process of technology appropriation in the same way it was being examined among Internet users in the U.S. and Europe. Ultimately, I realized that this work was yielding a different way of modeling the position of technology \\'users\\' that could contribute something to the technology for development debate. So, I arrived at this interest in a roundabout way. A Web site you recommend? All Africa ( allafrica.com ) is very complete site for news from all over Africa. Something few people know about you? My major hobby is rock-climbing, something I tried out for the first time as a teenager. It\\'s really hard to keep up with this, though, since I\\'ve been traveling and moving so much over the past couple of years. For the most part, I climb indoors at local climbing gyms. What keeps you up at night? I keep Post-It notes on my bedside table, because ideas (some good, some bad) tend to occur to me just as I\\'m about to drift off to sleep. <a class=\"addthis_button_facebook\" title=\"Facebook\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_twitter\" title=\"Twitter\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_google_plusone_share\" title=\"Google+\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_linkedin\" title=\"LinkedIn\"></a>\\n  <a class=\"addthis_button_email\" title=\"Email\"></a> People Faculty Staff Students Visitors Alumni Incoming Students How to reach me Office: 312 South Hall Office hours: Tuesdays, 3-5pm, room 312 Telephone: (510) 642-7584 Email: jenna@ischool.berkeley.edu Twitter: @jennaburrell Website Recent courses taught Fall 2016 Info 272.

The specific aims of my research are: (1) investigation of the HLA component of complex diseases, including delineating disease predisposing variants at the amino acid level, (2) study of complex genetic diseases, (3) investigation of the evolutionary history of the HLA region, and (4) study of overall human genetic variation. The HLA region, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of humans, contains a number of closely linked, highly polymorphic genes whose products control a variety of functions concerned with the regulation of immune responses. Selection has been very important in the evolutionary history of the HLA region. This is reflected in a number of features of HLA genetic variation. Also, over 50 diseases have been shown to be associated with the HLA region, these include: autoimmune diseases such as insulin dependent diabetes and multiple sclerosis; cancers such as Hodgkin disease; and infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and AIDS. These diseases are genetically complex and involve genetic heterogeneity in the HLA region and non-HLA genes. Our approach is multi-faceted, involving molecular biology in the study of HLA and microsatellite variation, mathematical and computer modeling, and empirical data analysis. My students are uniquely trained, in that those doing molecular biology laboratory work are also trained in population genetics, evolutionary theory, and the various aspects of data analysis, while those interested in statistical analyses and modeling have access to the data generated in our laboratory, as well as from collaborations and the literature. Our population and disease studies emphasize consideration of ethnic variation in human populations and across species variation. Selected Publications Meyer D, G. Thomson. 2001.

The central strategy involves the attachment of new functional components to specific locations on structural proteins, and the subsequent self-assembly of these conjugates into new types of materials with useful electronic and biological functions. Controlled Growth of Nanocrystalline Arrays Using Cytoskeletal Proteins Modern synthetic methods for the preparation of inorganic nanocrystals have yielded promising new components for optical and electronic device construction. However, the organization of these materials into functional assemblies remains extremely difficult, in part because the small size of nanocrystals (2-10 nm) is well below the spatial resolution of most lithographic techniques. An alternative approach could be provided by attaching these nanocrystals to specific sites on the surfaces of fiber-forming cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin. By controlling the polymerization of the actin conjugates with additional proteins and small molecule natural products, specified locations could be connected with wire-like arrays of functional materials. Once constructed, the arrays could be converted into conductive linkages, thus providing an entirely new method for nanoscale circuit construction. Modified Viral Capsids for the Assembly of Core/Shell Materials A second research area involves the synthesis of three-dimensional nanostructures from the self-assembling proteins that form the outer coats of viruses. For example, by selectively modifying the top and bottom faces of the satellite panicum mosaic virus capsid protein, new types of core/shell materials could be obtained after assembly. These structures could be developed into particles capable of targeting desired tissue types and releasing their cargo of drug molecules. Functionalized viral capsids could also provide new tools for the investigation of multivalent binding interactions that occur in biological systems. New Methods for Site-Selective Protein Modification A central theme in this research program is the modification of structural proteins in specific locations in order to achieve homogeneous and predictable assembly. Site-directed mutagenesis provides a powerful set of tools for this purpose, and will be used extensively. However, there are limitations associated with this technique, and therefore the development of new chemical approaches for protein modification will be pursued as well. This research will take advantage of the rapidly expanding set of organic reactions that can proceed in aqueous solution, and will utilize asymmetric ligands and catalysts to enhance the selectivity of protein modifications. Combinatorial reaction libraries will play an important role in this research area. Biography Professor. Born 1971. B.S. in Chemistry from Miami University, Oxford, OH, 1994.

O. Lawrence Award 1971. Neutrino Astrophysics, Paleoclimatology, Microbial Life in Solid Ice on Earth and Other Planets, and Microbial Evolution in the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Research Interests My interests as an experimentalist are broad. I like to develop projects that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. The projects in which my students, post-docs and I are engaged involve developing and exploiting novel instruments that probe polar ice down to depths of thousands of meters as well as those that map microbial life and volcanic records as a function of depth in deep ice. Current Projects IceCube High-Energy Neutrino Observatory My former students and I, in collaboration with a group at U. of Wisconsin, conceived the AMANDA project (Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array). AMANDA, installed in South Pole ice at depths 1500 to 2300 m. It operated from 2000 to 2011. In order to search for the very low flux of cosmic neutrinos with energy up to ~1e16 eV, we and an international consortium built the $250 million one-cubic-kilometer IceCube observatory, with 86 strings comprising a total of ~5000 optical modules at depths from 1450 to 2450 m in the deep ice at the South Pole. IceCube is by far the world’s largest neutrino observatory. With it we detect ultrahigh-energy neutrinos passing upward through the entire earth. It can answer fundamental questions in astrophysics (the nature of blazars and of gamma ray bursters), cosmology (the nature of the dark matter that comprises the majority of the mass of the universe), cosmic ray physics (origin of the highest energy cosmic rays), and particle physics (search for Lorentz violation, predicted by string theory; behavior of neutrinos in a gravitational field). Paleoclimatology and Glaciology Dr. Ryan Bay and I invented an optical dust-logging instrument that fits into deep boreholes in glacial ice and rapidly locates volcanic ash layers, records maxima and minima in the concentration of dust particles corresponding to glacial and interglacial climate, detects abrupt climate changes with a depth resolution of a few mm, and provides information about wind speed over the last 1e5 years. We discovered that large volcanic eruptions correlate with abrupt climate changes of as much as 20 degrees Celsius, and that many volcanic signatures in deep ice match up in both hemispheres and across the continent of Antarctica. To achieve the best possible angular resolution of sources of high-energy neutrinos, we use the dust logger in a number of boreholes to map the three-dimensional distribution of dust and ash in the 1 km-cube volume of IceCube. With miniaturized tilt meters attached to the pressure vessels containing IceCube phototubes, we study the shear rate of very cold ice. Life in Extreme Environments My students and I showed that micron-size bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes survive for more than 1e5 years at temperatures down to -50°C in glacial ice. They metabolize at an extremely feeble rate, just enough to repair spontaneous damage to DNA and amino acids. Occasional excesses of methane, nitrous oxide, and heavy oxygen (18O) observed by others in Greenland glacial ice are produced by localized excesses of certain microorganisms blown onto growing icecaps during severe storms. With a scanning spectrofluorimeter, we are mapping the chlorophyll and amino acid autofluorescence of microbes down the depths of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica that are stored in the National Ice Core Laboratory. We found that chlorophyll fluorescence decreases very slowly with depth and appears to be due to microbial death at a rate ~(depth)^-0.4. Experimental study of microbial evolution over 1e8 generations Using epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we find that most of the autofluorescing cells in glacial ice consist of two genera of submicron-size cyanobacteria – Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus – which give rise to almost half the oxygen in the atmosphere. With Bay Area geneticists we propose to study their evolution over nearly 1e8 generations by analyzing changes in their genomes in cells from both Greenland and Antarctic ice at 10 intervals of 10 thousand years. The challenge is to sort out genomic changes in a possibly large number of strains of the same species, which may vary from one ice sample to another. Recent advances in genomics make it possible to do analyses of less than 1 nanogram of DNA per liter of melted ice. Life on Mars? The instruments we develop can be adapted to a search for subsurface life on Mars, where methane emission has recently been detected with rapid seasonal changes, implying high production rates.

Hall Endowed Chair Chair of the UCB Computational & Data Science & Engineering Program Professor of Mechanical Engineering 6117 Etcheverry Hall, Mailstop 1740 University of California at Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720-1740 (510) 642-9172 Email: zohdi@berkeley.edu Biography and CV Tarek I. Zohdi received his Ph.D. in 1997 in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. He was a post-doctoral fellow at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany from 1997 to 1998 and then a lecturer (C2-Oberingenieur) at the Gottfried Leibniz University of Hannover in Germany from 1998 to 2001, where he received his Habilitation in General Mechanics. Approximately one out of every twenty Ph.D holders in Germany is allowed to proceed with a Habilitation. It is the highest academic degree in Germany and is usually required to obtain the rank of full Professor there and in other parts of Europe. In July 2001, he became an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He was promoted to Associate Professor in July 2004 and to Full Professor in July 2009. In July 2012, he was appointed Chair of the Designated Emphasis Program in Computational and Data Science and Engineering (DE-CSE) at UC Berkeley. Previously, he has served as Chair of the Engineering Science Program at UC Berkeley (2008-2012) and Vice-Chair for Instruction in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (2009-2012). He is currently a Chancellor’s Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Chair of the Computational and Data Science and Engineering Program at UC Berkeley and holder of the W. C. Hall Family Endowed Chair in Engineering. He also holds a Staff Scientist position at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs and an Adjunct Scientist position at the Children\\'s Hospital Oakland Research Institute. His main research interests are in micromechanical material design, particulate flow and the mechanics of high-strength fabric, with emphasis on computational approaches for advanced manufacturing and nonconvex multiscale-multiphysics inverse problems, in particular addressing the important issue of how large numbers of micro-constituents interact to produce macroscale aggregate behavior. He has published over 135 archival refereed journal papers and seven books: • Introduction to computational micromechanics (T. Zohdi and P. Wriggers, Springer-Verlag), • (An introduction to modeling and simulation of particulate flows (T. Zohdi, SIAM), • Electromagnetic properties of multiphase dielectrics: a primer on modeling, theory and computation (T. Zohdi, Springer-Verlag), • Dynamics of charged particulate systems: modeling, theory and computation (T. Zohdi, Springer-Verlag) and • A finite element primer for beginners-the basics (T. Zohdi, Springer-Verlag), • Modeling and simulation of functionalized materials for additive manufacturing and 3D printing: continuous and discrete media (T. Zohdi, Springer-Verlag) and • A finite element primer for beginners-extended version including sample tests and projects (T. Zohdi, Springer-Verlag), as well as four handbook chapters, three encyclopedia chapters and three contributed book chapters. In 2000, he received the Zienkiewicz Prize and Medal, which are awarded once every two years, to one post-graduate researcher under the age of 35, by The Institution of Civil Engineers in London, to commemorate the work of Professor O. C. Zienkiewicz, for research which contributes most to the field of numerical methods in engineering. In 2002, he received the Best Paper of the Year 2001 Award in London, at the Lord\\'s Cricket Grounds, for a paper published in Engineering Computations, pertaining to modeling and simulation of the propagation of failure in particulate aggregates of material. In 2003, he received the Junior Achievement Award of the American Academy of Mechanics. The award is given once a year, to one post-graduate researcher, to recognize outstanding research during the first decade of a professional career. In 2008, he was elected Fellow of the International Association for Computational Mechanics (IACM) and in 2009 he was elected Fellow of the United Stated Association for Computational Mechanics (USACM). The USACM is the primary computational mechanics organization in the United States and the International Association for Computational Mechanics is the primary international organization in this field. In 2011, he was selected as \"Alumnus of the Year\" by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Louisiana State University (LSU), where he did his undergraduate studies. He serves on the editorial advisory boards of ten international journals. Also, he is an editor of the leading journal Computational Mechanics and co-founder and editor-in-chief of a new journal, Computational Particle Mechanics. He is also an editor of a book series on Computational Mechanics, published by John-Wiley. He has organized or co-organized three international state-of-the-art CISM workshops (International Centre For Mechanical Sciences in 2002, 2005 and 2010) located in the Palazzo del Torso in the center of Udine, Italy, which is funded by UNESCO, the National Research Council of Italy (CNR), the International Union for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) and the European Mechanics Society (EUROMECH). In 2007, he was co-chair of the Ninth United States National Congress for Computational Mechanics, which is the largest conference in the field in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. He was elected President of the USACM in 2012, and served from 2012 to 2014. In 2009, he was elected to a six year term as a representative of the USACM on the General Council of the IACM, which is the governing committee of the primary international organization in his field of research. In 2014, he was appointed by the United States National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council as a member of the United States National Committee for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNC/TAM) representing the United States Association for Computational Mechanics for a four year term.

Sakurai Prize, Member, National Science Board, Member 1996-2002, American Philosophical Society. Research Interests I am interested in pushing particle theory beyond the well-established Standard Model. My work in recent years has focused on the symmetry breaking mechanism by which particles acquire masses, and more specifically on supersymmetry and supergravity. Supersymmetry provides a possible mechanism for understanding the large hierarchy in scale between the masses of particles studied with accelerators and the “natural” scale of physics which is the Planck mass. Supergravity, particularly when regarded as the “low energy” limit of superstring theory, provides the best hope at present for unification of all forces. My current research attempts to tie superstrings to observable physics. Current Projects I am studying effective supergravity theories for particle physics, with the goal of addressing the problems of supersymmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking, as well as other aspects of particle physics and cosmology, in the context of superstring theory. A part of this program requires an understanding of quantum corrections in the effective theory. My former graduate students, Vid Jain and Kamran Saririan, and I calculated the divergent one-loop corrections for supergravity coupled to chiral matter. In the course of this work I found a way to regulate the divergent integrals encountered in these calculations that is consistent with supersymmetry. More recently my former student Daniel Butter and I calculated the quantum anomalies in the regulated theory, and work on the implementation of full anomaly cancellation in superstring-derived supergravity models is in progress. A promising mechanism for supersymmetry breaking is a phenomenon called “condensation” that is known to play an important role in quantum chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions in the Standard Model. A scalar field known as the “dilaton” plays an important role in supersymmetry breaking via condensation. With collaborators in Paris and Boston, I showed how to describe gaugino condensation within the “linear supermultiplet” formulation for the dilaton. With a former graduate student, Yi-Yen Wu, we were able to construct a quasi-realistic model for supersymmetry breaking in superstring-derived supergravity. With former students (Daniel Butter, Andreas Birkedal-Hansen, Mike Cai, Joel Giedt, Ben Kain, Aleksey Mints, Brent Nelson), I have been studying the detailed implications of this model for phenomenology and cosmology.

Field aspects of the work include collecting fossils from long stratigraphic sequences that can be well-dated by biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic, or radioisotopic techniques. Lab analyses utilize database and GIS systems to identify faunal changes through space and time; the faunal patterns are then compared with independently identified changes in the physical environment to test various evolutionary and biogeographic predictions. Ongoing projects include: 1) Mapping the temporal and geographic occurrence of Miocene mammals in the United States under the auspices of the MIOMAP project. The goal is detailed comparison of the evolutionary and biogeographic patterns exhibited by Miocene mammals to tectonic and climatic events in the Montana-Wyoming Rockies, in order to determine how major environmental changes affected evolution and distribution of species. 2) Studying Pleistocene fossil mammals preserved in caves to understand biogeographic and morphologic changes that took place through glacial-interglacial cycles, which may help predict potential biotic effects of global warming. A new effort looks at cave and other Pleistocene faunas in California. 3) Understanding the effects of global climate change on mammalian communities and on such ecological metrics as biodiversity.

Daily Temperature and Income in the UnitedStates Co-author: Tatyana Deryugina GSPP Working Paper (December 2014) Abstract It is widely hypothesized that incomes in wealthy countries are insulated from environmental conditions because individuals have the resources needed to adapt to their environment. We test this idea in the wealthiest economy in human history. Using within-county variation in weather, we estimate the effect of daily temperature on annual income in United States counties over a 40-year period. We find that this single environmental parameter continues to play a large role in overall economic performance: productivity of individual days declines roughly 1.7% for each 1°C (1.8°F) increase in daily average temperature above 15°C (59°F). A weekday above 30°C (86°F) costs an average county $20 per person. Hot weekends have little effect. These estimates are net of many forms of adaptation, such as factor reallocation, defensive investments, transfers, and price changes. Because the effect of temperature has not changed since 1969, we infer that recent uptake or innovation in adaptation measures have been limited. The non-linearity of the effect on different components of income suggest that temperature matters because it reduces the productivity of the economy\\'s basic elements, such as workers and crops. If counties could choose daily temperatures to maximize output, rather than accepting their geographicallydetermined endowment, we estimate that annual income growth would rise by 1.7 percentage points. Applying our estimates to a distribution of \"business as usual\" climate change projections indicates that warmer daily temperatures will lower annual growth by 0.06-0.16 percentage points in the United States unless populations engage in new forms of adaptation.

TheAmerican Climate Prospectus(ACP) provides a groundbreaking new analysis of these and other climate risks by region of the country and sector of the economy. By linking state-of-the-art climate models with econometric research of human responses to climate variability and cutting edge private sector risk assessment tools, the ACP offers decision-makers a data driven assessment of the specific risks they face. The ACP is the result of an independent assessment of the economic risks of climate change commissioned by theRisky Business Project. In conducting this assessment, RHG convened a research team, co-led by climate scientistDr. Robert Koppof Rutgers University and economistDr. Solomon Hsiangof the University of California, Berkeley, and partnered withRisk Management Solutions (RMS), the world’s largest catastrophe-modeling company for insurance, reinsurance, and investment-management companies.

In this review, we survey this literature on the interlinkages between climate and conflict, by necessity drawing from both economics and other disciplines given the inherent interdisciplinarity of research in this field. We consider many types of human conflict in the review, including both interpersonal conflict - such as domestic violence, road rage, assault, murder, and rape - and intergroup conflict - including riots, ethnic violence, land invasions, gang violence, civil war, and other forms of political instability, such as coups. We discuss the key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships in this area, and largely focus on \"natural experiments\" that exploit variation in climate variables over time, helping to address omitted variable bias concerns. After harmonizing statistical specifications and standardizing estimated effect sizes within each conflict category, we carry out a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to estimate the mean effect of climate variation on conflict outcomes as well as to quantify the degree of variability in this effect size across studies. Looking across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially, with average effects that are highly statistically significant. We find that contemporaneous temperature has the largest average effect by far, with each 1σ increase toward warmer temperatures increasing the frequency of contemporaneous interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and of intergroup conflict by 11.3%, but that 2-period cumulative effect of rainfall on intergroup conflict is also substantial (3.5%/σ). We also quantify heterogeneity in these effect estimates across settings that is likely important. We conclude by highlighting remaining challenges in this field and the approaches we expect will be most effective at solving them, including identifying mechanisms that link climate to conflict, measuring the ability of societies to adapt to climate changes, and understanding the likely impacts of future global warming.

The claim is false. Buhaug et al.’s alteration of our metaanalysis misrepresents findings in the literature, makes statistical errors, misclassifies multiple studies, makes coding errors, and suppresses the display of results that are consistent with our original analysis.

Jina GSPP Working Paper (July 2014) Abstract Does the environment have a causal effect on economic development? Using meteorological data, we reconstruct every country\\'s exposure to the universe of tropical cyclones during 1950-2008. We exploit random within-country year-to-year variation in cyclone strikes to identify the causal effect of environmental disasters on long-run growth. We compare each country\\'s growth rate to itself in the years immediately before and after exposure, accounting for the distribution of cyclones in preceding years. The data reject hypotheses that disasters stimulate growth or that short-run losses disappear following migrations or transfers of wealth. Instead, we find robust evidence that national incomes decline, relative to their pre-disaster trend, and do not recover within twenty years. Both rich and poor countries exhibit this response, with losses magnified in countries with less historical cyclone experience. Income losses arise from a small but persistent suppression of annual growth rates spread across the fifteen years following disaster, generating large and significant cumulative effects: a 90th percentile event reduces per capita incomes by 7.4% two decades later, effectively undoing 3.7 years of average development. The gradual nature of these losses render them inconspicuous to a casual observer, however simulations indicate that they have dramatic influence over the long-run development of countries that are endowed with regular or continuous exposure to disaster. Linking these results to projections of future cyclone activity, we estimate that under conservative discounting assumptions the present discounted cost of \"business as usual\" climate change is roughly $9.7 trillion larger than previously thought.

In contrast, the nature and magnitude of post-disaster losses remain largely unknown because they are not easily observable. Here we exploit annual variation in the incidence of typhoons (West-Pacific hurricanes) to identify post-disaster losses within Filipino households. We find that unearned income and excess infant mortality in the year after typhoon exposure outnumber immediate damages and death tolls roughly 15-to-1. Typhoons destroy durable assets and depress incomes, leading to broad expenditure reductions achieved in part through disinvestments in health and human capital. Infant mortality mirrors these economic responses, and additional findings -- that only female infants are at risk, that sibling competition elevates risk, and that infants conceived after a typhoon are also at risk -- indicate that this excess mortality results from household decisions made while coping with post-disaster economic conditions. We estimate that these post-typhoon \"economic deaths\" constitute 13% of the overall infant mortality rate in the Philippines. Taken together, these results indicate that economic and human losses due to environmental disaster may be an order of magnitude larger than previously thought and that adaptive decision-making may amplify, rather than dampen, disasters\\' social cost.

Becauseweather is exogenous and random in most economic applications, it acts like a “naturalexperiment” and thus in some settings allows researchers to identify statistically the causaleffect of one variable on an economic outcome of interest (Angrist and Krueger 2001). Therelatively recent literature on the economic impacts of climate change has turned the spotlightonto quantifying the effect of climate on a number of economic outcomes of interest (e.g.,agricultural yields, mortality rates, electricity and water demand). This literature has oftenfound a nonlinear relationship between climate and these outcomes, with extremely warmtemperatures being especially important (e.g., Schlenker and Roberts 2009). Climate is a longaverage of weather at a given location. To identify the causal effect of climate on these outcomes,the literature has generally relied on either climate normals (i.e., long averages of observedweather in a cross-sectional setting) or day-to-day (or year-to-year) fluctuations inobserved weather as explanatory variables across time and space. The econometrician’s choice of a weather versus a climate measure as an explanatory variable critically affects theinterpretation of the estimated coefficients in the econometric model: that is, whether theoutcome is a true climate response or a short-run weather elasticity.

(2012). \"Adaptation to Cyclone Risk: Evidence from the Global Cross-Section.\" Climate Change Economics , Vol. 3 No.2. Abstract Understanding the feasibility and cost of adaptation is essential to management of the global climate. Unfortunately, we lack general estimates of adaptive responses to almost all climatological processes. To address this for one phenomenon, we estimate the extent of adaptation to tropical cyclones (TCs) using the global cross-section of countries. We reconstruct every TC observed during 1950–2008 to parameterize countries\\' TC climate and year-to-year TC exposure. We then look for evidence of adaptation by comparing deaths and damages from physically similar TC events across countries with different TC climatologies. We find that countries with more intense TC climates suffer lower marginal losses from an actual TC event, indicating that adaptation to this climatological risk occurs but that it is costly. Overall, there is strong evidence that it is both feasible and cost-effective for countries with intense TC climatologies to invest heavily in adaptation. However, marginal changes from countries\\' current TC climates generate persistent losses, of which only ~3% is \"adapted away\" in the long run. Civil Conflicts Are Associated with the GlobalCimate Hsiang, S.M. , K.C. Meng, M.A. Cane. \"Civil Conflicts are associated with the global climate.\" Nature , Vol. 476, p.438-441. Abstract It has been proposed that changes in global climate have beenresponsible for episodes of widespread violence and even thecollapse of civilizations. Yet previous studies have not shown thatviolence can be attributed to the global climate, only that randomweather events might be correlated with conflict in some cases. Here we directly associate planetary-scale climate changes with global patterns of civil conflict by examining the dominant interannual mode of the modern climate, the El Nin˜o/SouthernOscillation (ENSO). Historians have argued that ENSO may havedriven global patterns of civil conflict in the distant past, ahypothesis that we extend to the modern era and test quantitatively. Using data from 1950 to 2004, we show that the probabilityof new civil conflicts arising throughout the tropics doubles duringEl Nin˜o years relative to La Nin˜a years. This result, which indicatesthat ENSO may have had a role in 21% of all civil conflicts since1950, is the first demonstration that the stability of modernsocieties relates strongly to the global climate.

Abstract Understanding the economic impact of surface temperatures is animportant question for both economic development and climatechange policy. This study shows that in 28 Caribbean-basin countries, the response of economic output to increased temperatures isstructurally similar to the response of labor productivity to hightemperatures, a mechanism omitted from economic models offuture climate change. This similarity is demonstrated by isolatingthe direct inﬂuence of temperature from that of tropical cyclones, animportant correlate. Notably, output losses occurring in nonagricultural production (–2.4%/+1 °C) substantially exceed losses occurringin agricultural production (–0.1%/+1 °C). Thus, these results suggestthat current models of future climate change that focus on agricultural impacts but omit the response of workers to thermal stressmay underestimate the global economic costs of climate change.

       " 'Michael DeWeese': 'Research Area(s): Biophysics Biography Michael DeWeese received his BA (1988) in physics from the University of California at Santa Cruz and his PhD (1995) in physics from Princeton University. From 1995-1999 he took a computational postdoctoral appointment at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, with a fellowship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He then pursued experimental neuroscience as a postdoctoral researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, NY from 2000-2006. In 2007 he was appointed Assistant Professor at the University of California at Berkeley, with a joint appointment shared between the Physics Department and the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute. Research Interests Having to focus on one voice in a crowded room of boisterous speakers is a common experience for most of us, and we humans are extremely good at it, yet the latest algorithms running on the fastest modern computers fail miserably at isolating a single voice from a noisy background in all but the simplest cases. This demonstrates that attending to desired sounds in our everyday environment poses a surprisingly challenging computational problem for the brain—a problem whose solution would provide insight into the workings of the conscious mind and new approaches for designing man-made machines capable of intelligently processing real-world data. The impetus to understand how auditory attention is controlled by the brain is heightened by the fact that several prevalent mental disorders including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia are characterized in part by an inability to focus attention on important sounds in the presence of distractors. Inroads toward cures for these diseases would be enormously beneficial to those afflicted and to society as a whole. Fortunately, the last few decades have brought a revolution in cellular and molecular biology, providing neuroscientists with a powerful array of tools for monitoring and manipulating targeted elements within the intact cortical circuit. Moreover, decades of work on animal behavior have produced highly refined animal models of selective attention, along with tantalizing hints about the effects of attention on cortical circuits. Despite these developments, these complementary methodologies have yet to be brought together into a unified approach. The goal of my laboratory is to uncover the neural mechanisms subserving our remarkable ability to attend to desired sounds while ignoring others. Our approach is to develop a rodent model of selective auditory attention that is amenable to the full gamut of electrophysiological, optical, and molecular techniques that were originally developed for cellular-level questions. Now is a particularly exciting time in systems neuroscience, in which a young researcher can develop a mathematical theory for the behavior of a biological neural circuit, and then test the theory with a series of table-top experiments involving one or two experimenters—all within the same laboratory.

I am intrigued by the bizarre behavior of fully ionized plasmas, which mix long range electromagnetic forces with kinetic particle behavior. I merge these interests by studying the magnetospheres of neutron stars and their interactions with their environs, and their role in the acceleration of the highest energy cosmic rays. I also have interests in the magnetized accretion disks around black holes, whose physics has similarities to that of the outflows from rotation powered pulsars. Inquiries for research collaboration are welcome from graduate students interested in these and other topics in compact object.

       " 'Sandra Susan Smith': \"Associate Professor Research Interests: Urban poverty and joblessness, job search, social capital and social networks, trust and cooperation, and more recently, re-entry and the front end of criminal case processing Office: 468 Barrows Phone: 510.642.4298 Curriculum Vitae: Sandra Susan Smith CV July 2016.pdf Profile: I am primarily a qualitative researcher with a longstanding interest in questions of urban poverty and joblessness, social capital and social networks, racial inequality, intraracial dynamics, and trust. In my first book, Lone Pursuit: Distrust and Defensive Individualism among the Black Poor (Russell Sage Foundation), I advanced current and enduring debates about black joblessness, highlighting the role of interpersonal distrust dynamics between low-income black jobholders and their jobseeking relations that make cooperation during the process of finding work a problematic affair. It is in my second book, Want, Need, Fit: Cultural Logics of Job-Matching Assistance , currently under review, I more fully engage questions about the cultural underpinnings of social capital mobilization during the job-matching process, adding to my theoretical and empirical contributions from earlier work. I draw from a ethnoracial and class diverse sample of jobholders at one large public sector employer to investigate the network mechanisms that generate differential access to jobs. I show that variations in referrers' patterns of job-matching assistance can at least in part be attributed to distinct cultural logics of job-matching assistance, which inform the rules of engagement that shape whether, why, how and to whom potential referrers allocate economic resources. My research on this and related topics has also been published in a number of articles in such journals as the American Journal of Sociology , The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences , the Annual Review of Sociology , Racial and Ethnic Studies , Social Science Research , and The Sociological Quarterly . Recently my interests have expanded to include criminal justice issues, with special attention to the front-end of criminal case processing, a direct result of my membership in the Executive Session on Community Corrections at Harvard's Kennedy School and my membership on the National Research Advisory Board on Misdemeanor Justice. Specifically I have been considering the extent to which and how institutional arrangements related to the front end of penal contact contribute to the reproduction of racial and class inequalities. With a generous grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, I have begun a large, four-city qualitative study of the front end of criminal case processing, with a focus on how pretrial detention and diversion effect justice-involved individuals’ future involvement with crime. Defendants who initially appear to be quite similar can have very different criminal justice outcomes, in the short- and long-term. While some go on to engage in new criminal activity and, as a result, cycle in and out of jails and prisons, others abstain from participation in new criminal acts and thus limit further involvement with the penal system. A growing body of research links differing outcomes to experiences related to, among other things, diversion programs and varying lengths of pretrial detention; the former increases the odds of desistance, while the latter increases the odds of recidivism, even among low-risk offenders. To date, however, we know relatively little about how and why these interventions matter for future criminal involvement. The aim of my three-year project is to better understand how justice-involved individuals’ lives are altered in the short- and long-term by these criminal justice interventions, highlighting similarities and differences, across the four contexts (Baltimore, Chicago, Houston and San Francisco), in the extent and nature of pretrial diversion and detention procedures and defendants’ experiences. In the recent past I have also been deeply engaged service to the discipline, as ASA Council member, Deputy Editor of the American Sociological Review and chair of the ASA Section, Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility , among other commitments.

These findings result from a combination of organic synthesis, organometallic synthesis, protein design and evolution, and mechanistic analysis of catalytic systems. The Hartwig group is currently investigating both small-molecule catalysts and artificial metalloenzymes for selective reactions of organic molecules. These reactions include the selective catalytic functionalization of alkanes and arenes, cross-couplings to form aryl and allyl amines and ethers, α-aryl and α-allyl carbonyl derivatives, methods for the fluorination and fluoroalkylation of arenes, additions to alkenes, methods to prepare chemicals and polymers from renewable chemical feedstocks, and hydrocarbyl functionalization reactions catalyzed by artificial metalloenzymes that combine the reactivity of transition-metal catalysts with the selectivity and evolutionary potential of enzymes. His group has conducted extensive mechanistic investigations of each of these types of reactions. Through these studies, they have revealed several new classes of organometallic reactions, including reductive eliminations, discrete compounds that functionalize alkanes, unusual three-coordinate arylpalladium complexes that are intermediates in cross-coupling, the first compounds that oxidatively add ammonia to form monomeric products, and the first transition-metal amido and alkoxo complexes that insert unactivated alkenes. In addition to these research activities he has authored a leading textbook in organometallic chemistry, titled Organotransition Metal Chemistry: From Bonding to Catalysis.

In addition to a highly dynamic cytoskeleton composed of homologues of actin, tubulin and intermediate filaments, many prokaryotes possess intracellular membranous organelles. My lab uses the magnetosomes of magnetotactic bacteria as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms governing the biogenesis and maintenance of bacterial organelles. Using a variety of approaches, we identify and investigate key genes involved in controlling magnetosome formation and function. Lab Personnel Research Assembly and Subcellular Organization of Bacterial Organelles It has become increasing clear that bacterial cells are highly organized with many ultrastructural similarities to eukaryotic cells. In addition to a dynamic cytoskeleton composed of homologues of actin, tubulin and intermediate filaments, many bacteria also possess intracellular membranous organelles. Our lab uses magnetosomes as a model system for studying the molecular mechanisms of organelle biogenesis and maintenance in bacteria. The magnetosome chains of magnetotactic bacteria are one of the best-studied examples of membranous bacterial organelles. Magnetosome chains (see figure above) contain 15-20 approximately 50-nm magnetite crystals that act like the needle of a compass to orient magnetotactic bacteria in geomagnetic fields, thereby simplifying their search for their preferred microaerophilic environments. The unique properties of magnetosomal magnetite crystals have drawn attention to their potential use in biotechnology, bioremediation, and geobiology and have made them a genetically tractable system for the study of biomineralization. In addition to these applications, the cell biological characteristics of magnetosomes make them ideal for the study of organelle biology in bacteria. Each magnetite crystal within a magnetosome is surrounded by a lipid bilayer, and specific soluble and transmembrane proteins are sorted to the magnetosome membrane. These results suggest that to build a magnetosome a bacterium must be able to generate a membranous comparmtent, target the appropriate set of proteins to this membrane and control their number and position within a cell. My lab uses a combination of cell biological, genetic and biochemical approaches to define the physical characteristics of the magnetosome and identify key genes involved in controlling its production and function. Our earlier work showed that the magnetosome membrane is an independent organelle that pre-exists the formation of magnetite and that magnetite synthesis proceeds simultaneously from multiple adjacent magnetosomes. Recently, the work of several groups including ours has led to the identification of a large genomic region with many genes encoding proteins that are localized to the magnetosome and are essential for magnetite formation. The challenge now is to understand the specific functions of these genes and how their products interact to form a magnetosome.

These aims are achieved through several different experimental approaches and methodologies. First, we employ a neuroimaging method called functional MRI (fMRI) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates and temporal dynamics of various cognitive processes in normal human subjects. A key focus has been the cognitive functions supported by prefrontal cortex. Second, we have been investigating the role of the dopaminergic system in working memory and frontal lobe function. This aim is achieved with pharmacological studies during which direct dopaminergic agonists are administered to normal human subjects, as well as patients with frontal lobe lesions, to determine the effect of dopamine on cognition. Third, we perform behavioral studies in patient populations with frontal lobe dysfunction (e.g. stroke, head injury, Parkinson's disease) in order to further understand the mechanisms that underlie working memory. Finally, we are interested in understanding the physiological bases of normal human aging, and the effects of normal aging on prefrontal function. place Selected Publications Gazzaley A, Cooney J, McEvoy K, Knight RT, D’Esposito M .

Groves': 'Professor of Chemistry email: jtgroves@lbl.gov office: 408A Stanley Hall phone: (510) 666-3602 lab: 408A Stanley Hall lab phone: (510) 666-3602 Research Group Recent Publications Research Interests Physical chemistry in living systems Professor Groves is primarily interested in role of spatial organization in biochemical reaction systems. Living cells are not at all well-mixed reaction chambers. Rather, the molecular processes of life occur in elaborate spatial patterns. This interplay between spatial organization and the chemical reactions themselves in living systems adds a fascinating new dimension to chemistry that is rarely encountered outside of biology. Specific research in Professor Groves’ laboratory focuses on how spatial organization influences signal transduction processes at the cell membrane. The research methods combine techniques in optical microscopy and spectroscopy with materials fabrication methods and cell biology. This integrated approach enables the direct observation and physical manipulation of living reaction systems, down to the single molecule level. The conceptual approach is rooted in physics and physical chemistry, with the overarching goal of developing a quantitative and mechanistic understanding biochemical processes in living systems. Biography Jay T. Groves received his B.S. degree in Physics and Chemistry from Tufts University, and then went on to complete his Ph.D. in Biophysics with Professors Steven Boxer and Harden McConnell at Stanford University. He then spent a year as a visiting scholar at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan before becoming the Division Director’s Fellow in the Physical Biosciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 2001 he joined the Chemistry Department at UC Berkeley as an Assistant Professor. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2007 and Professor in 2010. In 2008 Professor Groves was appointed as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. He has received the Burroughs Wellcome Career Award in the Biomedical Sciences (2000), the Searle Scholars Award (2002), the MIT TR100 (2003), the Beckman Young Investigator Award (2004), and the NSF CAREER Award (2005). He has served as an Associate Editor of the Annual Reviews of Physical Chemistry since 2006.',\n",

In collaboration with Paul Kiparsky in Linguistics at Stanford University, I\\'ve ventured some hypotheses as to what a general theory of meter grounded in the phonology of the rhythm of natural language might look like, and in my own work have focused on how such a theory can illuminate the modern English metrical tradition, including not only its history and structure but also its aesthetic possibilities and achievements. I am also interested in parallel issues for poetics and aesthetics raised by other poetic forms like rhyme and alliteration. I am interested in the relationship of rhythm in meter and phonology to rhythm in music and dance, though the last of these I research primarily by studying international style ballroom dance with Mark and Andrea Nelson Novak. And I am interested in implications for environmental and social justice issues of natural grounding of aesthetic experience in our perceptual faculties. \\ufeff Specialties \\ufeff Linguistics Poetry \\ufeff Books Title Fields The Nature of the Word:  Studies in Honor of Paul Kiparsky ....

       " 'Dung-Hai Lee': 'Research Area(s): Condensed Matter Physics And Materials Science Biography Professor Dung-Hai Lee received his B.S. degree from the National Tsinghua University of Taiwan. He went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977 for graduate studies, and received his Ph.D. in physics in 1982. After staying at M.I.T. for another two years, he joined the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in 1984. Professor Lee spent eleven years at IBM, and came to Berkeley in February 1994. Research Interests Professor Lee is a theoretical condensed matter physicist. The principal goal of his research is to uncover new states of matter and understand their physical properties. He approaches this goal by engaging in three different types of research activity: 1. theoretically proposing new states of matter that transcend conventional paradigms, 2. performing analytic or numerical computation on models of strongly correlated systems, and 3. constructing phenomenological theory to extract the underlying physics from important experiments. Throughout the past ten years, he has worked on problems related to high-transition temperature superconductivity, photoisomerization, the fractional quantum Hall effect, superconducting nano wires, graphene, KxC60 monolayers, strongly correlated one dimensional systems, time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductors, frustrated spin models, carbon nano tubes, and transport of electron in strong magnetic fields and disorder media. Current Projects The following are examples of Professor Lee’s recent research. Fractional charge: In the seminal papers by Jackiw and Rebbi of particle physics, Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger of condensed matter physics, it was shown how charge which is only a fraction of the electronic charge can appear in one dimensional systems. For systems of dimensionality greater than one, there is no analogous paradigm dictating under what condition fractional charge will appear. In a recent work, Professor Lee and collaborators have shown that, in two dimensions, fractional charge will naturally appear in a ``topological insulator”. In addition, they unexpectedly found that, despite the difference in dimension, the principle found by Jackiw, Rebbi, Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger is also applicable here. Photoisomerization(PI) is a phenomenon where a molecule absorbs a photon and changes its shape. It is an important example of nano electronic-mechanical phenomena. It is the basis of vision. As a nano phenomenon, PI is sensitive to the environment.In a recent work, Professor Lee and his collaborators have put forward a theory for PI in a dissipative environment which predicts the existence of a quantum phase transition between a PI active state to a state in which PI is quenched completely as the molecule-environment coupling become very strong. Mott insulator without symmetry breaking: Landau’s idea that through the process of ordering, a system also becomes less symmetric, is now commonly known as ‘‘symmetry breaking’’. It underlies our general understanding of order in a wide variety of systems. In recent years, condensed matter physicists have been asking whether the electrons in a particular type of insulator, the “Mott insulator” can remain unordered at absolute zero temperature. Such a “featureless Mott insulator” has been sought after for many years without obvious success. In a recent work Professor Lee and his collaborators have shown that such a novel insulating state can arise from unusual conservation laws. Quasiparticle interference: As the tip of a scan tunneling microscope moves across the surface of High-transition temperature superconductor a weak quasiperiodic variation in the tunneling conductance was observed by Professor Seamus Davis’s (now at Cornell) experimental group. Professor Lee and collaborators developed the so-called quasiparticle interference model which is shown by Professor Davis’s group to be tremendously successful in explaining the data. This model has become the standard interpretation of this important phenomenon of high temperature superconductors. Superconductiviy in nanowires: In one-dimensional superconducting wires, quantum phase fluctuations can destroy long-range phase coherence even at zero temperature. Stimulated by an unexpected ``anti-proximity effect’’ discovered at Penn state, Professor Lee and collaborators showed that it is possible for the superconductivity in a nanowire to be stabilized by coupling to a dissipative environment.

The broad goal of my research is to understand psychopathology as a set of dynamic processes – in which thoughts, feelings, and actions are idiosyncratically organized within each individual. Research in my lab can be broadly categorized within the following domains. Personalized Assessment and Psychotherapy : Here we use intensive repeated measures of ambulatory data to generate person-specific models of psychopathology, and to personalize the delivery of psychotherapy to individual profiles and needs. Psychophysiology of Trauma and Distress : I am currently using experimental and ecological paradigms to investigate the potential physiological correlates of depression, anxiety, and trauma. My interest is to explore the phenomenology and function of physiological parameters in order to begin to understand the complex connections between psychopathology and health. place Selected Publications Fisher, A.J., Reeves, J.W., & Chi, C.

       " 'Jovan Scott Lewis': 'Jovan Scott Lewis Assistant Professor Ph.D., London School of Economics Economic geography, constructions and infrastructures of poverty, inequality, race (blackness), economy, and the market; the Caribbean (esp. Jamaica) and African-American communities 563 McCone Hall jovan@berkeley.edu I am an Assistant Professor of African-American Studies and Geography at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as the co-chair of the Economic Disparities Research Cluster at Berkeley’s Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society (HIFIS). I received my Ph.D. in Anthropology from the London School of Economics. My research examines race through the economic ethics, rationalizations, and practices that organize the lived experience of poverty and inequality in the Caribbean and the United States. My work in Jamaica, where I conducted research on what I called the “sufferation” economy, explored the social practices and cultural forms that facilitate the locating, reconciling, and normalizing of structural economic and social inequality through local market frames. My current research in Tulsa, Oklahoma is concerned with how the poor navigate the structural and infrastructural frictions of their poverty. I am currently planning a future project, “The Fourth Node: Global Shipping Logistics and the Political Ecology of Kingston Harbor.” “The Fourth Node” will analyze Jamaican development, nationalism, and ecological sovereignty through the privatization of Kingston Harbor and nearby nature sanctuary, Goat Islands, in Jamaica’s bid to become the fourth node in the global logistics shipping chain. Across these various geographies, my interests remain situated within the landscape of adverse economic circumstances, at scales ranging from the ethical to the global, especially when the adversity is the result of racial inequality, or a more structural economic deficiency or failure. I am especially interested in how race frames the experiences of those challenges and how a lack of resources is reconciled through attempts to rectify or simply cope with its absence. This theme runs through my published work, as well as my current book project, provisionally titled, Reparative Circuits: Crime, Capital and P ostcolonial Connection in Jamaica. Reparative Circuits examines how disadvantaged black youth in Jamaica engaged in the practice of international “lottery scamming”mobilize a reparative logic of seizure in utilizing the development apparatuses of internet communication technology, customer service procedures, and money transfer services, to secure economic and social mobility. Understanding the means of coping with inequality and economic adversity, and how their internalization produces cultural forms, provides a productive understanding of how they operate and become socially and economically mobilized. This philosophy is central to my work as co-chair of the Economic Disparities Research Cluster at HIFIS, where I bring anthropological and geographic insight to bear on debates on inequality.

       " 'William Sha': 'William Sha Contact Info Associate Professor of Immunology and Pathogenesis Full Directory Information Research Interests We are interested in understanding the molecular control of antibody responses by B cells. We previously identified a novel costimulatory molecule, B7h, expressed on B cells and other antigen-presenting cells that is the sole in vivo ligand for the ICOS costimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells. B7h is highly regulated and appears to be a critical control point on B cells for controlling the magnitude of antibody responses. We have identified two potent mechanisms, ectodomain shedding and transcriptional regulation, that severely limit B7h expression on activated B cells. We are currently studying how these molecular mechanisms are regulated and control antibody responses using both in vitro tissue culture assays and transgenic/knockout mouse models. Current Projects Control of B7h shedding by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are innate pattern recognition receptors that are critical for identifying infectious agents and shaping the correct adaptive immune responses of B cells and T cells. We recently found that CpG DNA, the ligand for TLR9, potently inhibits ectodomain shedding of B7h on B cells. These results indicate that B7h can exist in vivo in two distinct states: a labile form whose ability to signal ICOS is quickly terminated by shedding and a shedding-resistant form induced by TLR9 with sustained ability to signal ICOS on activated T cells. We are investigating the molecular mechanisms by which TLR7/8 and TLR9 ligands inhibit shedding of B7h on B cells by identifying both the protease(s) responsible for B7h shedding and the signaling components that are involved. We are also examining whether similar regulation of B7h by TLR ligands occurs on dendritic cells that regulate differentiation of T cells. Is control of B7h expression a B cell-extrinsic mechanism involved in autoimmunity? Both TLR9/CpG DNA and ICOS/B7h receptor/ligand signaling pathways are critical in the development of autoimmune antibodies that cause diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. While CpG DNA is known to cause direct cell-intrinsic activation of B cells, it is not known how cell-extrinsic activation of T cells by B cells, that is required for the development of autoimmune disease, is triggered CpG DNA. We are using transgenic and knockout mouse models to examine whether stabilization of B7h by TLR9 is an important molecular mechanism by which CpG DNA initiates autoimmune antibody production. Functional retroviral screens for host defense genes. Retroviral vectors provide a rapid and effective means to examine the function of different gene products in immune cells. We have adapted this approach to study host-pathogen interactions using Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite that is a significant infectious agent in immunocompromised patients. Within host cells, Toxoplasma gondii parasites reside within a highly specialized parasitophorous vacuole, and can interconvert between a rapidly dividing tachyzoite state and a dormant bradyzoite state. We are conducting screens with retroviral cDNA libraries to functionally identify host defense genes that regulate both growth and conversion of Toxoplasma gondii within host cells.

Reading it has been an eye-opening experience to the point that I feel that I will never be able to approach my own work and scholarship in the same way. As far as I am concerned, this book will be mandatory reading for all of my students. This book deserves to be widely read and debated by every student of Islam, by every reader who believes that he or she knows what Islam and Muslims are about, and even by every person who might have the most casual interest in the contemporary Muslim realm.” --Khaled Abou El Fadl, University of California-Los Angeles “This book constitutes a major milestone in moving beyond stereotypes and anecdotal evidence, and identifying the ways in which Muslim-majority societies actually are distinctive from other types of societies, utilizing a huge base of empirical cross-national evidence.” --Ronald Inglehart, University of Michigan “There’s no book to my knowledge that does what Fish accomplishes here…It provides us with the most comprehensive and scientifically rigorous study of the political, social, and religious attitudes of Muslims in cross-national perspective.” --Amaney A. Jamal, Princeton University “A refreshingly brash book. Skilled in empirical analysis, Steven Fish has avoided the temptation to define questions narrowly…Fish insists on following the data wherever it leads him, informed by past scholarly work but not bound by its conventions. He seeks neither to challenge nor confirm popular prejudices. As a result of this sweeping, data-centered approach, both scholarly and non-scholarly audiences will find the book by turns comforting and unsettling.” --Nathan J.

It argues that Catholic women not only entered politics much earlier than is generally thought (by the time of the mid-century Reform), but also entered as independent \"players,\" not as pawns of priests. Women were thus consequential actors within the church, as well as in Mexican politics, and the early strength of their presence on the political scene helps us to understand the continuing importance of the Catholic church in Mexican politics to this day.

       " 'Jeffrey Neaton': 'Research Area(s): Condensed Matter Physics And Materials Science Biography Jeffrey B. Neaton received his Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 2000. After a postdoc at Rutgers University, and after having worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a postdoc and staff scientist at the Molecular Foundry, he joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 2014. He is currently Director of the Molecular Foundry, a Department of Energy Nanoscale Science Research Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he is also a Senior Faculty Scientist. Neaton has received a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Outstanding Achievement Award in 2007, and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2009. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society, and presently a Division Associate Editor for Physical Review Letters. Often taking place in close collaboration with experiments, Neaton’s current research emphasizes the development and use of ab initio and analytical methods for the understanding of complex and correlated condensed phases of organic and inorganic solids, nanostructures, and interfaces; electronic excited state phenomena, including quasiparticle and optical excitations; weak interactions in nanoporous materials; and low-dimensional transport behavior, particularly in single-molecule junctions. An important context for his research of late has been renewable energy, where novel materials, excited states, oxides, organics, and interfaces feature prominently. Research Interests My research centers on understanding and design of novel condensed phases and their properties with theoretical and computational approaches. A major theme of my work is to devise analytical and computational methods that exploit connections between these disparate materials classes to create general approximations and methods, design new materials, and understand novel phenomena. An ultimate aim is the development of new intuition – or “design rules” – connecting emergent properties and function to chemical composition and structure. As such, I draw upon and develop contemporary “first principles” density functional theory (DFT)-based approaches, theoretical methods at the nexus of condensed matter physics, nanoscience, quantum chemistry, and computational materials. My work is multidisciplinary, focuses on both hard and soft matter, and reflects a breadth consistent with the applicability of first-principles DFT-based methods. I interact closely with experimental research groups to guide and be inspired by state-of-the-art studies of real physical systems, and to validate and further develop our fundamental understanding of condensed matter. Most recently, I have focused on understanding novel phase behavior, and transport and spectroscopic phenomena, in (i) molecular and organic assemblies; at (ii) interfaces between highly dissimilar materials, e.g. organic-inorganic; in (iii) complex oxides with strong spin-orbit coupling; and in (iv) metal-organic frameworks, extended nanoporous solids. Although distinct, these materials classes share astonishing structural and chemical diversity; highly-localized, sometimes strongly-correlated electronic states; and, in instances, appreciable non-covalent interactions. As such, they simultaneously present significant opportunities for discovery and drive the development of contemporary electronic structure theory. An important context of my work has been solar energy conversion and carbon emissions mitigation, where excited states, oxides, organics, and interfaces feature prominently. Publications T.

Formerly he was the dean of the School of Information, University of Michigan. At Michigan, he was also the Arthur W. Burks Professor of Information and Computer Science, and a professor of economics and public policy. He was the founding director of STIET (a research program for Socio-Technical Infrastructure for Electronic Transactions). He is passionate about public universities, where he has spent his entire career. Current Research My research and teaching mix mostly economics with some computer science, and a bit of psychology (cognitive, and increasingly social) thrown in. In recent years I\\'ve addressedhuman information behavior online, and the design and performance of information systems and digital content. Applications include the design of complex online markets (and developmentof emerging empirical game theory techniques), user-contributed content, individual privacy and security, pricing and bundling of digital information,and congestion pricing for Internet services.My approach is incentive-centered design which accounts for the behavior of autonomous, motivated and often strategic humans when designing systems. Ialso work on competition policy and antitrust, especially for information technology-related industries. In the past I contributed to researchon taxation and corporate behavior, and public utility pricing.

Current Projects Professor Ramesh is known throughout the world for his contributions to the science and technology of complex functional oxide materials. Working initially in the early 1990’s at Bellcore, he made landmark contributions in ferroelectric perovskites through the recognition that conducting oxide electrodes are the solution to the problem of polarization fatigue, which for 30 years, remained an enigmatic, unsolved problem. This is now recognized worldwide: many industrial and academic research laboratories have implemented his approach and the first series of products based on the use of conducting oxide electrodes are hitting the marketplace. In 1994, in collaboration with S. Jin (Lucent Technologies), he initiated research into manganite thin films and they coined the term, Colossal Magnetoresistive (CMR) Oxides; the paper published in Science is the 4th highest cited paper (more than 2000 citations). This work was the starting point for an intense international R&D effort on these materials, with several promising approaches for new devices. He continues to pursue key scientific and technological problems in half metallic magnetic oxides within a framework of multicomponent oxide thin films and heterostructures. His work in this field has also led to the discovery of novel field effect devices that combine the properties of ferroelectric and magnetic perovskites. His current research activities encompass probing the physics of nanoscale phenomena in complex oxide heterostructures, multifunctional oxides, approaches to create self-assembled functional nanostructures, integration of complex oxides with semiconductor technologies, and the use of nanoscale scanned probes to understand fundamental properties and dynamics in such materials. His work is cited extensively (over 13000 citations), and he ranks among the Highly Cited Physicists around the world in the Physics Citation Index. He has been issued 26 patents with 1 more under consideration. He was honored by the International Symposium on Integrated Ferroelectrics with an Outstanding Achievement Award in 2000. In 2001, he was awarded the Humboldt Senior Scientist Prize by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and Fellowship in the American Physical Society.

       " 'Matt F. Traxler': \"Matt F. Traxler Bacterial interspecies interactions and specialized metabolism Assistant Professor 311 Koshland Hall Berkeley, California 94720-3102 Phone 405.990.2168 Lab Phone 510.642.8058 mtrax@berkeley.edu http://traxlerlab.berkeley.edu Research Going Forward Publications Matt Traxler received his BS and PhD in microbiology from the University of Oklahoma, and was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School. His PhD studies used whole-genome transcriptomics and network analyses to understand stress responses in E. coli. His postdoctoral studies have included the use of NanoDESI and MALDI-TOF imaging mass spectrometry to examine chemical exchange during actinomycete interactions. His research aims include integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic paradigms with the ultimate goal of understanding the role of specialized metabolism in bacterial interactions and translating this knowledge into a platform for natural products discovery. Research Most studies of bacteria are done in pure culture, investigating a single species in isolation. Yet, in natural environments, bacteria live in complex communities of interacting species. My research explores the chemical ecology of interactions between actinomycete bacteria. Collectively, actinomycetes are the single deepest source of medicinal natural products, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticancer agents (Fig. 1). Interactions between actinomycetes involve a remarkably rich chemical repertoire and provide a new approach for discovering novel natural products. My research program will incorporate whole-genome transcriptomics and newly developed mass spectrometry techniques to examine the physiology of actinomycete interactions as they relate to natural product biosynthesis and translate these insights into a new platform for natural products discovery. Streptomyces coelicolor is the best-understood actinomycete. It is genetically tractable and its developmental lifecycle and secondary metabolism have been extensively studied. S. coelicolor makes multiple pigmented antibiotics whose production can be easily seen in colonies. These pigments provide a dramatic phenotype illustrating that co-cultivation alters the physiology of this bacterium. For example, the images in Fig. 2 showthat co-cultivation with another actinomycete stimulates production of the red antibiotic prodigiosin, but this compound is not made in pure culture. However, this is merely the “tip of the iceberg” of the alterations in physiology that result from co-cultivation. My research uses innovative molecular biology, chemistry, and informatics techniques to understand the global changes that occur during actinomycete interactions and the role of specialized metabolites in actinomycete biology. New tools for studying chemical exchange between bacteria Acquiring deep and accurate chemical profiles of interspecies interactions as they occur is critical to understanding them. Two recently developed mass spectrometry techniques that have revolutionized the detection of molecules in bacterial colonies will be utilized in the Traxler lab. The first of these is nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (NanoDESI MS). The NanoDESI MS workflow is shown schematically in Fig. 3. Compounds are desorbed directly from the sample surface in a small droplet of liquid. The compounds are then fragmented in the mass spectrometer, ultimately yielding individual tandem mass spectra for the thousands of ions detected. These metabolomic data are computationally assembled into networks that allow for systems-level interpretation and can guide compound identification. Thus, NanoDESI allows deep metabolomic sampling of a variety of biological surfaces. The second of these techniques is matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) (Fig 4). It allows high-resolution mapping of compounds in microbial colonies. A laser is used to desorb molecules from the sample surface. Moving the laser in a grid format yields mass spectra from ordered points across the sample. These spectra are used to build images depicting the distribution of individual chemical species. This technique allows phenotypes to be correlated with the presence of chemical compounds. An important aim is to couple mass spectral data with global transcriptional profiling of S. coelicolor to gain an in-depth view of the physiological changes triggered by interspecies interactions. This will entail obtaining chemical profiles and RNAseq data of S. coelicolor during interspecies interactions. These data will allow correlation of the expression of natural product biosynthetic genes with compounds observed in the samples. Subsequently, the expression of natural product biosynthetic genes can be connected with physiological responses also observed in the global transcriptome profiles. Going Forward The Traxler lab seeks to simultaneously build: 1) a framework for studying the physiology of interspecies interactions, and 2) an innovative program for natural products discovery. The unique combination of nascent metabolomic techniques and transcriptomics, complemented by a perspective rooted in bacterial physiology, will provide a much deeper picture of how interspecies interactions can impact specialized metabolism, and the role these compounds play in natural settings. The critical new information learned from these experiments will, in turn, be leveraged to maximum effect in the search for new natural products of potential therapeutic value.

Quantum and Optical Electronics, TuTh 2:00PM - 3:29PM, Dwinelle 243 Biography Eli Yablonovitch introduced the idea that strained semiconductor lasers could have superior performance due to reduced valence band (hole) effective mass. With almost every human interaction with the internet, optical telecommunication occurs by strained semiconductor lasers. He is regarded as a Father of the Photonic BandGap concept, and he coined the term \"Photonic Crystal\".  The geometrical structure of the first experimentally realized Photonic bandgap, is sometimes called “Yablonovite” . In his photovoltaic research, Yablonovitch introduced the 4(n squared) ( “Yablonovitch Limit” ) light-trapping factor that is in worldwide use, for almost all commercial solar panels. His mantra that \"a great solar cell also needs to be a great LED”, is the basis of the world record solar cells:  single-junction 28.8% efficiency; dual-junction 31.5%; quadruple-junction 38.8% efficiency; all at 1 sun. His startup company Ethertronics Inc., has shipped over 1.7 billion cellphone antennas. He co-Founded Luxtera Inc., the originator and world leader of Silicon Photonics. Prof. Yablonovitch is elected as a Member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and is a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London.  He has been awarded the Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society, the Isaac Newton Medal of the UK Institute of Physics, the IEEE W.R. Cherry solar cell award, the Rank Prize (UK), the Harvey Prize (Israel), the IEEE Photonics Award, the IET Mountbatten Medal (UK), the Julius Springer Prize (Germany), the R.W. Wood Prize, the W. Streifer Scientific Achievement Award, and the Adolf Lomb Medal.  He also has an honorary Ph.D. from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, & the Hong Kong Univ. of Science & Technology, and is honorary Professor at Nanjing University. Eli Yablonovitch is the Director of the NSF Center for Energy Efficient Electronics Science (E 3 S), a multi-University Center headquartered at Berkeley.  \\nHe received his Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics from Harvard University in 1972.  He worked for two years at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and then became a professor of Applied Physics at Harvard. In 1979 he joined Exxon to do research on photovoltaic solar energy. Then in 1984, he joined Bell Communications Research, where he was a Distinguished Member of Staff, and also Director of Solid-State Physics Research. In 1992 he joined the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was the Northrop-Grumman Chair Professor of Electrical Engineering. Then in 2007 he became Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, where he holds the James & Katherine Lau Chair in Engineering.

       " 'Thomas B. Gold': 'Professor Research Interests: Modernization and development, globalization, comparative institutions, Pacific Rim societies, China, culture, non-profits focused on improving educational access and persistence for disadvantaged populations Office: 446 Barrows Phone: 510-642-4760 Profile: Thomas B. Gold is Professor of Sociology at the University of California. Since 2000 he has also served as Executive Director of the Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies (IUP), a consortium of 14 American universities which administers an advanced Chinese language program at Tsinghua University in Beijing. ( http://ieas.berkeley.edu/iup ]. At Berkeley he has also served as Associate Dean of International and Area Studies, Founding Director of the Berkeley China Initiative, and Chair of the Center for Chinese Studies. Professor Gold got interested in China as an undergraduate at Oberlin College. After graduating he taught English at Tunghai University in Taichung, Taiwan. He then received a Masters in Regional Studies-East Asia and a PhD in Sociology, both from Harvard University. While at Harvard he was among the first group of American exchange students to study in China, spending a year at Fudan University in Shanghai, from February 1979-February 1980. He also worked part-time for many years as a Chinese language escort-interpreter for the Sate Department. Prof Gold’s research focuses on many aspects of the societies of East Asia, primarily mainland China and Taiwan. In the largest sense, he examines the process of the emergence of the increasingly empowered and autonomous individual and a private sphere in societies which have combined traditional and modern forms of authoritarian rule. He explores this from many angles: youth and the life course; personal relations ( guanxi , social capital), private business and entrepreneurship, popular culture, non-governmental organizations, and civil society. His book, State and Society in the Taiwan Miracle (1986) was the first to apply theories of dependency, world systems and dependent development – up to that time based mainly on the experience of Latin America - to an East Asian case. He continues to write about changes in Taiwan society since the end of Martial Law in 1987. Prof Gold regularly teaches courses on Introductory Sociology, Development and Globalization, and Contemporary Chinese Society. He recently taught seminars on “’’The Simpsons’’ Global Mirror,” North Korean Society, and non-profits in the education field. He won a Distinguished Teaching Award from the Division of Social Science in 2007. He is teaching in the UC Education Abroad Program at Fudan University, Shanghai, in the fall of 2012. Prof Gold is a strong advocate of public sociology and has served on the boards of many civic organizations. He currently sits on the boards of The National Committee on U.S.- China Relations, the Asia Society of Northern California, and East Bay College Fund, which provides scholarships and mentors for graduates of Oakland public high schools who attend four-year colleges or universities ( www.eastbaycollegefund.org ). He is an adviser to Strait Talk and East-West Coalition, two international student groups, and is an external advisor to programs at universities in Japan and Singapore. He serves on the editorial board of many scholarly journals as well. He received the Chancellor’s Award for Civic Engagement in 2010.

       " 'Kathleen Collins': \"Kathleen Collins Contact Info Walter and Ruth Schubert Family Chair, Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Lab Homepage: https://sites.google.com/site/kcollinslab/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Collins lab interests center on the eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase telomerase, cellular RNP biogenesis pathways, and non-coding RNA. Current Projects Telomerase RNP biogenesis, activity and regulation The reverse transcriptase telomerase adds simple-sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template within its integral RNA subunit. Newtelomeric repeat synthesis by telomerase can compensate for the loss of repeats that occurs with each round of genome replication, but how the balance of telomere lengthening and telomere erosion is monitored and how this balance is regulated remain unknown. We study telomerases both as recombinant enzymes, to understand the unique structureand dynamic nucleic acid handling properties of the ribonucleoprotein complex, and also in cells, to understand the complex pathways for active RNP biogenesis and regulation at telomeres. Many of our studies focus on the protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid recognition specificities and conformational changes that underlie the telomerase catalytic cycle of short repeat synthesis. Exploiting the ciliate Tetrahymena as a model system, we accomplished the purification, characterization and reconstitution of a complete, biologically functional telomerase holoenzyme. Ongoing studies pursue the delineation of individual telomerase holoenzyme subunit functions. In parallel we are using biochemical, molecular and cellular assays to investigate the assembly and regulation of human telomerase in embryonic stem cells and cancer cells. We use diverse approaches from the level of structural biology to biochemical characterization of macromolecular interactions to genome engineering. New functions for non-coding RNA We have been applying our insights from studies of telomerase RNA to more general investigations of non-coding RNA biogenesis and function. In human cells we have discovered new RNA processing pathways and RNA functions in stress response and innate immunity. In Tetrahymena we continue to discover new mechanisms by which nuclear-localized Piwi proteins influence gene expression and epigenetic inheritance.

Major themes include the diagnostic validity of childhood disorders, the role of family and peer relationships in normal and atypical development, the early prediction of behavioral and learning problems, the neuropsychology and neurobiology of impulsive and externalizing behavior, expressions of psychopathology in female samples, and the implementation of combinations of psychosocial and pharmacologic intervention for children with externalizing behavior disorders, with strong emphasis on moderators and mediators of outcome. Increasingly, research interests are focusing on adolescent and young adult outcomes, as the youth in his various projects continue to participate in prospective, longitudinal studies. An additional area of focus is the stigmatization of mental illness, with interest in a variety of related topics (e.g., interpersonal manifestations of stigma, implicit attitudes, developmental processes, media influences, dehumanization, international efforts to combat stigma). For many years he conducted intensive summer research programs for atypical and comparison populations. Observations of ongoing behavior allow investigations of the interrelationships among social behavior, peer reputation, moral reasoning, parenting style, and diagnostic status. The female sample who participated in the late 1990s constitutes the largest preadolescent study of girls with ADHD in existence; they have now completed their prospective 10-year follow-up, with a 95% retention rate. A fourth, 15-year follow-up, also funded by NIMH, beganin Fall, 2013. Another major project involves a multi-site, long-term clinical trial of medication and psychosocial interactions for children with ADHD: The MTA Study). As the Principal Investigator for the Berkeley site, Hinshaw has conducted investigations of predictors, moderators, and mediators of treatment outcome. Prospective follow-up investigations into adulthood are now underway. A third federally funded study involves a clinical trial of integrated psychosocial treatment (family, school, and child components) for children with the Inattentive type of ADHD, conducted jointly at Berkeley and UCSF. Hinshaw has other grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (related to a new book on policy and ADHD) and the Fogarty Center (continued international training of mental health professionals and scientists). He has an NSF grant related to summer mentorship of underrepresented minority undergrads. Students who work with Dr. Hinshaw learn extensively about the assessment of childhood behavioral disorders; theoretical linkages among cognitive, behavioral, and peer-related systems in normal and atypical development; social and clinical psychological aspect the writing of both empirical research reports and review articles; and social and clinical issues related to stigmatization. Both experimental and longitudinal research design skills are emphasized, with particular focus on data analytic tools. Students are encouraged to receive broad training in child and adult psychopathology, psychological evaluation, multivariate statistics, developmental psychology, social psychology, and psychopharmacology. place Selected Publications Hinshaw, S.

       " 'Jacob Corn': 'Jacob Corn Contact Info Assistant Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology* *and Affiliate in Division of Cell and Developmental Biology, and Scientific Director of the Innovative Genomics Initiative (IGI) Lab Homepage: http://cornlab.com/ Full Directory Information Research Interests The Corn Lab develops and uses next-generation genome editing and regulation technologies to enable fundamental biological discoveries and develop potential therapies for human genetic diseases. We focus on the mechanisms by which cells repair their DNA and use ubiquitin signaling to propagate cellular signals. Through technology development, mechanistic cellular biochemistry, and translational projects, we are working to unravel complex cellular phenotypes to further biological understanding and improve human health. Cells must maintain the integrity of their genomes or risk permanent damage to functional sequences. Eukaryotes have evolved a wide variety of integrated pathways to sense and repair multiple types of DNA damage, from bulky lesions to double strand breaks. Deficiencies in these pathways can cause cells to accumulate genomic errors that lead to human diseases, including somatic cancers and Mendelian inherited genetic disorders. Harnessing DNA repair through the development of programmable nucleases such as ZFNs, TALENs, and recently CRISPR-Cas effectors is revolutionizing approaches to fundamental biological discovery and holds great promise for the cure of genetic diseases. Next-generation gene editing tools, exemplified by CRISPR-Cas effectors such as Cas9, are fundamentally DNA damaging agents that introduce double strand breaks (or nicks if so engineered). Hence, they are inextricably linked to DNA repair in that they represent new opportunities to study DNA repair in human cells and intensify the urgency of studying these processes. Research in the Corn lab seeks to understand the intersection between human DNA repair and genome editing tools and to develop new approaches to cure human diseases using genome editing. We furthermore use advanced genome editing to uncover the mechanisms by which cells use ubiquitin-based signals to encode information, including the stimulus-dependent destruction of entire organelles. We take a multidisciplinary approach to tackle these problems that includes computational modeling, in vitro biochemistry and biophysics, genome-wide screening, and mechanistic cellular biochemistry. Current Projects The intersection of DNA repair and genome editing The development of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing and regulation is transforming biological research and has opened up potential therapeutic avenues. However there are still many problems that we lack the tools to tackle. For example, while Cas9 can be used to \"knock out\" genes through error-prone sequence disruption, methods to precisely insert or replace sequences are still in their infancy. Gene editing outcomes are currently unpredictable in part because we have fundamental gaps in our understanding of DNA repair. As a programmable nuclease, CRISPR-Cas9 represents both a powerful tool to edit the genome through the controlled introduction of DNA damage, and also an exciting new opportunity to study the ways in which human cells keep their genomes intact. We are working to determine the molecular mechanisms by which cells process DNA damage, such as that which is incurred during genome editing, with the goal of furthering fundamental understanding of DNA repair and finding routes to high efficiency gene correction. Using genome editing to decipher ubiquitin signals The attachment and removal of ubiquitin from substrate proteins can encode a wide range of signals, controlling cellular phenotypes from cell division to organelle abundance. But the complex genetics and many players involved in ubiquitin signaling have made it slow and difficult to decipher these functional networks. We are using next-generation genome editing and regulation technologies to gain molecular insight into ubiquitin-mediated signaling cascades involved in cellular homeostasis. For example, using unbiased screens with complex phenotypes, we are uncovering novel ubiquitin-related effectors that regulate processes such as human DNA repair and organelle autophagy. Endogenous tagging and editing approaches enable us to gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms by which these effectors encode and decode ubiquitin-mediated signals. Translational impact in the real world Genome editing holds great promise to uncover the root causes of human diseases and even to reverse mutations that cause inherited genetic disorders. We collaborate with clinicians and industry groups to translate genome editing approaches towards real world applications. Working with therapeutic companies, we use CRISPR screening technologies in challenging contexts to identify and validate druggable targets in emerging therapeutic areas. We have recently determined how certain cancer cells resist cutting-edge targeted oncology therapies and are developing strategies to bring them back under control. We also use genome editing to explore the mechanisms by which genomic variation causes or modifies disease, for example by introducing disease-associated noncoding SNPs into human cells. Finally, we develop reagents aimed at curing genetic disorders via precision sequence replacement, for example by correcting the sickle cell disease mutation in human hematopoietic stem cells.

(Geophysics) McGill 1992 S.M. (Engineering Sciences) Harvard 1994 Ph.D.(Earth and Planetary Sciences) Harvard University I study geological processes involving fluids, including problems in physical volcanology, geodynamics, hydrogeology, and geomorphology. Though the range of topics may appear diverse, the common theme is an attempt to develop a better quantitative understanding of physical processes operating in the Earth. Depending on the nature of the problem, I have used some combination of theoretical, numerical and experimental approaches. Because we are trying to understand natural systems, integrating observations and field data (both of active processes and recorded in the geologic record) with theoretical and model results is also an essential component of my research. Often the fluid mechanics that we need to understand has not yet been studied. Consequently, my research typically involves new contributions in applied mechanics. Recent contributions include studies of convection, the properties and dynamics of suspensions, flow and transport in porous materials, percolation theory, and high pressure mineral physics. This work is currently funded by the National Science Foundation, the Petroleum Research Fund, the Sloan Foundation, and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

       " 'Yasunori Nomura': 'Research Area(s): Particle Physics Biography Yasunori Nomura received his Ph.D. from University of Tokyo in 2000, where he held a fellowship of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. He was a Miller Research Fellow at University of California, Berkeley from 2000 to 2002, and an Associate Scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory from 2002 to 2003. He joined the Berkeley physics faculty in July 2003.Awards and honors include: DOE Outstanding Junior Investigator Award (2004), Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship (2005), Hellman Family Faculty Fund Award (2005), and Simons Fellow in Theoretical Physics (2012). Research Interests Yasunori Nomura works mainly on particle physics theory and cosmology. He has developed the framework of grand unified field theories in higher dimensions (sometimes called “orbifold GUTs”) and proposed it as simultaneous solutions to the problems of 4-dimensional supersymmetric grand unified theories, such as the doublet-triplet splitting, too fast proton decay, and wrong fermion mass problems [1]. Based on this framework, he constructed first fully realistic models in which standard model gauge and Higgs fields, as well as gauge and Yukawa couplings, are unified in higher dimensions [2]. He also works on new physics theories beyond the standard model at the TeV scale. He proposed a class of models in which the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson from an extra dimensional component of a gauge field in dual higher dimensional warped space (called holographic Higgs models) [3], identified a region of parameter space in weak scale supersymmetry where the fine-tuning of electroweak symmetry breaking is minimized (called natural supersymmetry) [4], introduced a framework in which a precise prediction of the Higgs boson mass is obtained because of supersymmetry broken at high energies (the high scale SUSY scenario) [5], and proposed a scenario in which supersymmetry is broken in multiple separate sectors, leading to rich experimental signatures coming from multiple weakly interacting Goldstone fermion particles (the Goldstini scenario) [6]. More recently, he has proposed that the eternally inflating multiverse and many worlds in quantum mechanics are the same concept [7]. He has developed a new theoretical framework to describe dynamics of quantum gravity in low energy regimes, preserving locality [8]. This leads to a picture that general relativistic, global spacetime is an only emerging, classical concept arising from a special relativistic, quantum mechanical description of quantum gravity. He has applied this idea to the multiverse, in which the multiverse state does not have a beginning or end and time emerges only locally in branches corresponding to our own universe (the static quantum multiverse) [9].

       " 'Brian Wright': 'Brian Wright Professor of Agr Econ/Econ Agr Exp Sta & GFAE About Brian Wright My interests in economics uncertainty and innovation date from my early experiences on my family’s sheep station in the Riverina district of New South Wales, Australia. I received a Bachelor of Agricultural Economics (First Class honors) from the University of New England, Armidale, and won one of two Frank Knox Fellowships given annually to Australian students by Harvard University, where I received an A.M. and Ph.D. in Economics. I then joined Yale University’s Economics Department and am now a faculty member in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. I am a Fellow of the American Agricultural Economics Association. I served as the economist member of the Subcommittee on Proprietary Science and Technology of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). I served on the Committee on Intellectual Property in Genomic and Protein Research and Innovation of the National Academies’ Board of Science, Technology and Economic Policy. I have recently collaborated with the Research Center for Property Exchange of Peking University. Last June, at the request of the World Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, I gave a technical presentation at the World Grain Forum, Petersburg, Russia, on the use of international grain reserves for market stabilization. In October 2010 I presented an invited paper on agricultural innovation at the Washington, DC National Bureau of Economic Research meeting on Accelerating Innovation in Energy: Lessons from Other Sectors? I subsequently presented invited lectures on grain markets and their stabilization at the World Bank, the Milken Institute, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Research Description: My research interests include economics of markets for storable commodities, market stabilization, agricultural policy, industrial organization, public finance, invention incentives, intellectual property rights, the economics of research and development, and the economics of conservation and innovation of genetic resources. I co-authored or co-edited several books, including Storage and Commodity Markets; Reforming Agricultural Commodity Policy; Saving Seeds: The Economics of Conserving Genetic Resources at the CGIAR Centers, and Accessing Biodiversity and Sharing the Benefits: Lessons from Implementing the Convention on Biodiversity. I have published extensively in the leading journals in Economics and Agricultural Economics.

       " 'Qiang Zhou': 'Qiang Zhou Contact Info Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/zhou/ Full Directory Information Research Interests We are studying the mechanisms and factors that\\r\\ncontrol transcriptional elongation and how this control affects HIV\\r\\nreplication, latency activation and cancer progression. Current Projects The elongation phase of\\r\\n  RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription is widely used to regulate the expression\\r\\n  of metazoan genes, especially those for cell growth, renewal and\\r\\n  differentiation. Composed of CDK9 and cyclin T (CycT), the positive\\r\\n  transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is one of the most important factors\\r\\n  that promote the transition of Pol II from promoter-proximal pausing into\\r\\n  productive elongation. P-TEFb acts by phosphorylating the Pol II C-terminal\\r\\n  domain (CTD) and negative elongation factors to antagonize the latter’s\\r\\n  inhibitory effects. This leads to the synthesis of full-length RNA transcripts\\r\\n  and the coupling of transcription with pre-mRNA processing. In human cells, not only\\r\\n  is P-TEFb crucial for the expression of numerous cellular genes, it is also an\\r\\n  indispensable host cofactor for efficient transcription of the HIV genome. Our\\r\\n  recent data indicate that the HIV-encoded Tat protein\\r\\n  and TAR RNA, a stem-loop structure found at the 5’ end of nascent viral\\r\\n  transcripts, recruit P-TEFb and several other transcription\\r\\n  factors/cofactors in the form of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC, Fig. 1) to the integrated HIV proviral genome. SEC contains two different elongation factors, P-TEFb and\\r\\n  ELL2, connected by the scaffold protein AFF4\\r\\n  or AFF1. Upon recruitment to the viral promoter, P-TEFb and ELL2 act on\\r\\n  the same polymerase enzyme to synergistically activate HIV transcription. The\\r\\n  sequestration into a SEC and interaction with Tat also stabilize ELL2, which\\r\\n  otherwise would be a short-lived protein targeted by the E3 ubiquitin ligase\\r\\n  Siah1 for proteasomal degradation. Besides being recruited by Tat/TAR to\\r\\n  activate HIV, SEC is also employed by the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein\\r\\n  and its fusion partners to promote the expression of MLL-target genes and\\r\\n  leukemogenesis. In addition to SEC, our\\r\\n  data indicate that P-TEFb also exists in at least two other complexes (Fig. 1).\\r\\n  First, most cellular P-TEFb is normally sequestered in an inactive state in the\\r\\n  7SK snRNP. We have previously identified 7SK snRNA as well as HEXIM1/2, LARP7\\r\\n  and MePCE proteins as key subunits of this complex and determined their roles\\r\\n  in inhibiting CDK9 kinase, maintaining 7SK snRNP integrity and suppressing\\r\\n  cellular transformation. A number of conditions/reagents that globally impact\\r\\n  cell growth and/or induce stress response can disrupt 7SK snRNP to release\\r\\n  P-TEFb for enhanced gene expression. We also show that Tat can directly extract\\r\\n  P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP for subsequent assembly of the Tat-SEC complex on HIV\\r\\n  promoter. Another major P-TEFb\\r\\n  complex identified by us and others contains the BET bromodomain protein Brd4.\\r\\n  This protein acts as the host equivalent of HIV Tat to capture P-TEFb released\\r\\n  from 7SK snRNP for delivery to promoters of many cellular, especially primary\\r\\n  response genes (Fig. 1) through the interaction of its bromodomains with\\r\\n  acetylated histones. Recently, the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 is shown to displace\\r\\n  Brd4 from acetylated chromatin thereby inhibiting the transcription of key\\r\\n  Brd4/P-TEFb-dependent genes such as c-Myc and inducing differentiation and growth arrest of Myc-dependent cancer cells. As for HIV transcription, because Brd4 is abundant and can directly compete\\r\\n  with Tat for binding to P-TEFb, it strongly inhibits Tat-transactivation. With\\r\\n  the identification of three major P-TEFb complexes that constitute a functional\\r\\n  network to control HIV and cellular gene expression, we are in a unique\\r\\n  position to investigate whether and how this network may be therapeutically\\r\\n  exploited to treat human diseases such as HIV/AIDS and cancer. A current\\r\\n  project in the lab attempts to manipulate the P-TEFb network to activate\\r\\n  transcriptionally silent HIV in latently infected T-cells, which is the primary\\r\\n  hurdle to eradication of infection. Identification of agents/strategies that\\r\\n  activate latent provirus may, in the presence of highly active antiretroviral\\r\\n  therapy (HAART), permit clearance of HIV reservoirs by the immune system.\\r\\n  Another project in the lab seeks to identify cancer- and stage-specific changes\\r\\n  in the P-TEFb network, which may serve as markers of disease progression and\\r\\n  prognosis and potentially be reversed/altered to disrupt oncogenic\\r\\n  transformation. We are also performing structure-function analysis of the major\\r\\n  P-TEFb complexes to study how they are assembled and how the P-TEFb activity is\\r\\n  regulated positively or negatively by its various associated factors.

His research, teaching, and advisory work focus on the political economy of knowledge intensive industries, with special attention to health care, information technology, software, and global political economy issues relating to competitiveness. He is also a frequent contributor to scholarly and public debates on international politics and US foreign policy. One of the world’s most expert practitioners of scenario planning,Weber has worked with over a hundred companies and government organizations to develop this discipline as a strategy planning tool. Steve went to medical school at Stanford then did his Ph.D. in the political science department also at Stanford. He served as special consultant to the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and has held academic fellowships with the Council on Foreign Relations and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and was Director of the Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley from 2003 to 2009. His books include The Success of Open Source and most recently The End of Arrogance: America in the Global Competition of Ideas (with Bruce Jentleson) and Deviant Globalization: Black Market Economy in the 21st Century (with Jesse Goldhammer and Nils Gilman). He is currently working on a new book, Beyond the Globally Integrated Enterprise , that explains how economic geography is evolving and the consequences for multinational organizations in the post financial crisis world. Steve is the faculty director for the Berkeley Center for Long Term Cybersecurity (CLTC). What brought you to the I School? I came to the I School because of my substantive interests in political economy of information-intensive production, but also because I am learning to build prototypes and experiments as a way to evaluate and test theory in this fast-evolving space. As the data \\'revolution\\' evolves, I\\'ve become increasingly interested in how decision-makers, particularly inside complex organizations, will (and should) use data products to inform strategic decision making. What information issues interest you most? I’ve had a long-standing interest in the open source software community that hasn’t ebbed; but these days, I’m particularly interested in the economic models that support the production and delivery of information services and data products — a problem that some people think has been \\'solved\\'. Not even close! The international dimension is probably the most interesting to me right now, as I believe national economic development theories and policiesare starting to takeseriously the long term consequences of the data \\'revolution\\'. You\\'ve been on the Berkeley faculty (in the department of political science) since 1989; how have your academic interests evolved during that time? My theoretical interests haven’t really changed that much. I’ve always studied large scale systems of non-hierarchical cooperation, and I’ve tended to follow that puzzle into different substantive areas — from international regimes to open source software communities. I suspect some version of that problem will keep me busy for another couple decades at least. A Web site you recommend? Wordle.net . Make your own word clouds! A very compelling and memorable way to make a point, when used in the right circumstances. Something few people know about you? I’d rather be on my road bike than just about anything else. There is no endorphin high like that in the digital world. What keeps you up at night? The ‘other side’ of the acute phase of the 2008–9 financial crisis. We haven’t really begun to see the full range of political-economic-social fallout from this series of events, and a sense of complacency has snuck back in. The world is going to look very different in 2020, but most Americans (including much of the educated elite) is now acting as if the crisis was just a blip on the screen and we’re back to \\'trend\\' in most respects, with an occasional burst of concern about inequality, populism, and the like. I think it\\'s a much bigger discontinuity, and that’s going to become evidentover time.

I am particularly interested in systematic questions that address evolutionary processes, historical biogeography and ecology, and relationships of California plants and their descendant lineages elsewhere (e.g., Hawaii). My research on the California tarweeds and the Hawaiian silversword alliance (Compositae: Madiinae) has involved testing of hypotheses concerning diversification processes and rates, chromosomal and morphological evolution, ecological shifts, dispersal events, and the evolutionary importance of hybridization. I am also involved in collaborative investigations focused on evolution of breeding and pollination systems in flowering plants. Laboratory techniques used in my research include DNA sequencing and cytogenetic and morphological analyses. Recent theoretical and technological advances in systematics offer exciting opportunities for studies of California plant evolution and relationships. The rich diversity of the California flora and the extensive literature from evolutionary research on California plants pose well-defined and important systematics research problems for graduate study.

My book manuscript “Mistresses of the Market: White Women and the Economy of American Slavery,” which is under contract with Yale University Press,is a regional study that draws upon formerly enslaved people’s testimony to dramatically reshape current understandings of white women’s economic relationships to slavery.The book is based on my revised dissertation, which won the Organization of American Historians’ 2013 Lerner-Scott Prize for the best doctoral dissertation in U.S. women\\'s history.“Mistresses of the Market” puts narrative sources, legal documents, and financial records into conversation with each other in order to show how white women’s investments in the institution shaped their gender identities and to situate them firmly at the center of 19 th century America’s most significant and devastating system of economic exchange. It begins by tracing white women’s ideological development as slave owners from girlhood to adulthood. By doing so, it reveals that white parents raised their daughters with particular expectations related to owning slaves and taught their female progeny how to be effective slave masters. These lessons played a formative role in how white women conceptualized their personal relationships to human property, imagined the powers that they would possess once they became slave owners, and shaped their techniques of slave control. Elucidating these lifelong processes of indoctrination makes it clear why some white women did not feel compelled to relinquish control over their slaves to spouses once they married, and why they sought to manage and “master” their slaves, too. It also makes clear why manyslave-owningwomen responded to the Civil War and adapted to its economic aftermath in the ways that they did. As a whole, this book offers more expansive and differently gendered understandings of American slavery, the trans-regional domestic slave trade, and nineteenth-century slave markets. Graduate Advising I’d be delighted to work with graduate applicants who are interested in African-American history, the history of American slavery, slavery and the law,the history of women, andwomen and the law. Note about Letters of Recommendation for Undergrads If you are considering asking me to write a letter of recommendation for you, please be mindful of the following. I prefer to write letters of support for students who have completed two or more classes with me . Even for those students who have taken multiple courses with me, I can only write a substantive letter of support if I know you. Simply earning an “A” in the class is not enough. I have to know something about you, so it is in your best interest to make yourself known to me. Visit me during office hours ( if you have a reason ), actively participate in class, ask questions in and out of class if you have any. In short, set yourself apart from your classmates. If you don’t do these things, there isn’t much that I can write about beyond your letter grade. Under these circumstances, I would possess a limited understanding of your preparation for graduate studies, and the little knowledge that I would possess about your overall performance here at Berkeley, would not allow for me to write the kind of recommendation letter that graduate schools would want to receive. The best professors to do so would be those who you\\'ve had more than one small, seminar-style classes with and/or those with whom you\\'ve worked closely and have read and critiqued your written work. If I can\\'t speak to your extensive engagement with course materials, class participation and engagement with classmates, I can\\'t really speak to these other critical factors. If I agree to write a letter of recommendation, you must request it at least FOUR WEEKS before the deadline. Additionally, you must provide the following, without exception: Recommendation Letter Deadline. Scholarship/Job/Graduate school to which you are applying. Website/info about the opportunity/job/academic program. Original recommendation letter instructions Person to whom the recommendation should be addressed. Instructions on how/where to send/deliver recommendation letter C.V./Resume Application materials you plan on submitting (draft or final versions if available) If you plan to apply to more than 2-3 schools, I recommend that you create an Interfolio account at: https://www.interfolio.com/ which allows your letter writers to upload their letters and then allows you to send them to as many schools as you want. There is a small fee to sign up, but I find that it is worth it. In-Class Announcements If you would like to make an announcement that is addressed to undergraduates enrolled in my lecture courses, please email me at sejr@berkeley.edu for prior approval at least two days before you would like to visit. MyUndergraduate Research Apprentice Program Projects for Fall 2016-Spring 2017 The Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program (URAP) provides an opportunity for Berkeley undergraduates to work with faculty members on their cutting-edge research projects. As part of this initiative, I am working with undergraduate apprentices on several data collection projects.Detailed descriptions of my URAP projects and what apprentices will be asked to do can be found here: http://urapprojects.berkeley.edu/projects/detail.php?id_list=His0717 Students meet regularly with me (every 2 weeks) for research mentoring and may earn 1 unit of academic credit for each 3 hours of research work (limited to 4 units per term). The program is designed to stimulate awareness of advanced research and interest in graduate study. Students arenot paidfor their participation. However, you DO acquire experience that can be placed on your resume/CV. If you are interested in being considered for my URAP projects you can find out more about the application process, including the actual application, here: http://research.berkeley.edu/urap/. History majors are strongly preferred. You may submit applications forno more than three URAP projectsand you can work on only ONE URAP project in a semester. Interested students can submit applications online. The deadline for the Spring semester has passed.

Hickman': 'Professor of the Graduate School Email: caroleh@berkeley.edu Phone: (510) 642-3429 Full Contact Information > Research Description My research seeks new understanding of the diversity of structure and function in living and fossil organisms by integrating formal (morphogenetic) historical (phylogenetic) and functional (adaptive) explanations. Theoretical, constructional, evolutionary, and develop-mental morphology provide the conceptual and practical tools that I use to analyze structure and function. Molluscs are the primary subject organisms for defining principles of structure. I have developed new model systems: the gastropod radula, suspension feeding devices, and the gastropod larval shell, as well as novel tools that include design spaces, ecospaces, ethospaces, and developmental spaces in which phylogenetic trajectories illustrate macroevolutionary trends and patterns. As paleobiologist and geologist, I am investigating the taphonomic assembly and patterning of shell beds in the fossil record and the responses of community architecture to global climate change during the Cenozoic Era. Recently completed projects include an astrobiological theory of the role of microbial-metazoan interactions in extreme environments, an analysis of the \"problem of similarity,\" and an analysis of changes in shell biomineralization at metamorphosis that are reflected in funeous composite bioinorganic materials. Students in my laboratory develop their own research questions and systems. We share a common passion for evolutionary history and structure that includes the use of molecular tools.

Research William F. Hanks studies the history and ethnography of Yucatan, Mexico, and Yucatec Maya language and culture, including early modern Spain and Spanish as a necessary step towards understanding the colonial formation of Yucatan and New Spain. He examines the organization and dynamics of routine language use (semantics, pragmatics, interactional sociolinguistics and the social foundations of speech practices). He has studied ritual practice, comparative shamanisms, and the relations between religion and health care in rural Mexico. His most recent work concerns the colonial history of Yucatan and New Spain, with a special emphasis on missionization and the emergence of colonial discourse genres. Profile I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics and Anthropology from the University of Chicago in 1983, and remained on the faculty of both departments from 1983 to 1996, when I was appointed Professor of Anthropology and Milton H. Wilson Professor of the Humanities, at Northwestern University. In July 2000 I joined Cal as the Berkeley Distinguished Chair Professor in Linguistic Anthropology. I have been a visiting professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Science Sociales (1988, 1992), the University of Paris X (1995), the University of Copenhagen (1996, 1999), the Casa de America, Madrid (1993, 1999) and the International Center for Semiotic and Cognitive Studies, San Marino (1998). My work is resolutely interdisciplinary and international. The empirical basis of my research has been the history and ethnography of Yucatan Mexico, where I have conducted about 30 months of fieldwork and archival research. My speciality is Yucatec Maya language and culture and all of my fieldwork has been conducted in Maya language. I have become increasingly interested in early modern Spain and Spanish as a necessary step towards understanding the colonial formation of Yucatan and New Spain. My work is oriented towards three areas, and the theoretical frameworks needed to understand them. The first is the organization and dynamics of routine language use (semantics, pragmatics, interactional sociolinguistics and the social foundations of speech practices). Here I have been particularly concerned with how people make reference to, describe and orient themselves in space. My first book (1990) was a study of lived space in contemporary Maya interaction and the contribution of demonstratives and deictics to communicative practice. The second area in which I have done sustained fieldwork is shamanism. This began with an extended collaboration with a contemporary Maya shaman in Yucatan, and has led me to study ritual practice, comparative shamanisms, and the relations between religion and health care in rural Mexico. The third focus of my work is the colonial history of Yucatan and New Spain, with a special emphasis on missionization and the emergence of colonial discourse genres. The latter include a wide range of evangelical texts in Maya, the grammars, dictionaries and other analytic works by missionaries in Yucatan, as well as a substantial corpus of texts authored by native Maya speakers (notarial documents as well as so called \\'indigenous genres\\').

McBride Professor Emeritus of Landscape Architecture & Environmental Planning Specializations Vegetation and ecological analysis; urban forestry; historic landscape restoration. Education Ph.D. Botany, University of California, Berkeley M.S. Forestry, University of California, Berkeley BS Forestry, University of Montana, Missoula Philosophy Statement My philosophy in education is to provide both knowledge and experiences where students can apply the knowledge to solving problems of landscape design, land use planning, and resource management. I believe students must develop a dedication to land stewardship based on a scientific understanding of the characteristics and dynamics of landscape regions. My teaching, research, and professional practice is aimed at application of ecological understanding to landscape planning and management. I teach courses dealing with basic principles of ecology and courses dealing with the application of ecology to planning and management. My research has spanned a spectrum from urban to wildland studies. At its primary focus has been an interest in understanding how different land use activities influence patterns of plant succession. The professional practice I am engaged in is concerned with vegetation management. Biography Professor McBride\\'s current research involves projects on (1) the effects of urban forests in the reduction of air pollution in China, (2) the composition, structure, and function of urban forests in different biomes, (3) the role of fire in riparian woodlands of the Sierra Nevada, and (4) wind patterns, micro-climates, and windthrow hazard in urban areas. Professor McBride\\'s professional projects include the Vegetation Management Plan for the Sea Ranch, Sonoma County, CA; Urban Forest Management Plan for Presidio of San Francisco; Restoration Plan for Sutro Baths, GGNRA, San Francisco; Oak Restoration Management Plan for Stanford University Academic Reserve Lands, Palo Alto, CA; analysis of boulevard trees for El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA. Professor McBride is Chair of the Forest Science Division ofthe Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management. In addition to his teaching, Professor McBride has worked as a consulting Forester and Landscape Ecologist in the Bay Area for over 40 years. His consulting work focuses on the preparation of vegetation analysis and management. His clients have included federal, state, county, and city agencies, legal firms, corporate land owners, private land owners, and foreign governments.

Anzia': 'About Research In the News Areas of Expertise Elections Government Politics State and Local Politics and Policy Public Sector Unions Women in Politics Public Employee Pensions Biography Sarah Anzia is a political scientist who studies American politics with a focus on state and local government, elections, interest groups, political parties, and public policy. Her book, Timing and Turnout: How Off-Cycle Elections Favor Organized Groups , examines how the timing of elections can be manipulated to affect both voter turnout and the composition of the electorate, which, in turn, affects election outcomes and public policy. She also studies the role of government employees and public-sector unions in elections and policymaking in the U.S. In addition, she has written about the politics of public pensions, women in politics, the historical development of electoral institutions, and the power of political party leaders in state legislatures.Her work has beenpublished in the American Political Science Review , the American Journal of Political Science , the Journal of Politics , the Quarterly Journal of Political Science , and Studies in American Political Development . She has aPh.D. in political science from Stanford University and an M.P.P. from the Harris School at theUniversity of Chicago.

In this paper, I carry out a test of the expected turnout-policy connection using variation in senior citizen turnout in city elections and the senior-friendliness of city transportation policy. Surprisingly, my results do not support the conventional wisdom: I find no clear association between the percentage of seniors in the electorate and better transportation for seniors. I then use this null finding as a launching pad for developing expectations about the conditions under which a group of citizens will influence policy. In a second round of analysis, I find support for those expectations: transportation policies are friendlier to seniors in cities where seniors are a cohesive, politically-focused group, and where they engage in political activities other than voting.

Moe GSPP Working Paper (August 2016) Abstract A subversive line of new scholarship in American politics argues that interest groups need to be brought to the analytic center of the field once again. This paper attempts to further that agenda. We reconnect with an older literature of great importance—on capture, subgovernments, and interest group liberalism—to study interest groups as insiders that play routine, officially recognized roles as part of government itself. Our empirical focus is on state-run public pension boards: which control trillions of dollars, have vast fiscal and social consequences, and are commonly designed to give public employees and their unions official roles in governing their own pension systems. We develop a theory arguing—contrary to existing scholarly work—that these groups can actually be expected to favor policies that undermine the fiscal integrity of these plans. Through an analysis of key decisions by 99 pension boards over the period 2001-2014, we show that this is in fact the case—and that, for public-sector pensions, these “interest groups on the inside” wield genuine influence that weakens effective government.

Meeks GSPP Working Paper (May 2016) Abstract The theory of political parties advanced by Cohen et al. (2008) and Bawn et al. (2012) has stimulated a productive debate about the form, activity, and influence of parties in American politics. So far, however, it has mainly sought to explain the role of parties in U.S. national politics. We propose that studying political organizations in local politics—where we cannot take it for granted that parties will always be active—has great potential to advance our understanding of parties, interest groups, and the relationships between them. In this paper, we start by presenting descriptive information on the activity of political parties in over 300 municipal governments across the United States. We find that parties are highly engaged in many of the cities, but we also find that their presence is far from universal. We then set out to explain the variation in party activity across cities, showing that they are more active in cities with partisan elections and in cities with a great deal of interest group activity. Importantly, though, we also find that there are many cities where parties are absent but interest groups are still active. It is possible, then, that the parties we do find to be active in local elections are not acting as umbrella groups steered by coalitions of local policy demanders, but instead are just another type of group trying to influence elections, working alongside but not in coordination with local interest groups. We then use these findings as a jumping off point for an extension and revision of some of the theoretical ideas advanced by Bawn et al., arguing that there are conditions under which policy demanders have incentives to work alone—not within party coalitions.

I use such an approach, which Hacker and Pierson (2014) call a “policy-focused approach,” to develop hypotheses about how the amount of interest group involvement in city politics varies with city characteristics, as well as hypotheses about how the kinds of interest groups that are active depends on group- and city-level factors. I test these hypotheses using data from a survey of elected officials in over 500 U.S. municipal governments, providing the first-ever bird’s-eye view of interest group activity in a diverse set of American cities. My findings reveal that the size and composition of city interest group systems vary in ways consistent with my hypotheses, demonstrating the promise of this theoretical approach.

Moe. 2016. \"Do Politicians Use Policy to Make Politics? The Case of Public-Sector Labor Laws.\" American Political Science Review 110 (4):763-777. Abstract Schattschneider’s insight that “policies make politics” has played an influential role in the modern study of political institutions and public policy. Yet if policies do indeed make politics, rational politicians have opportunities to use policies to structure future politics to their own advantage—and this strategic dimension has gone almost entirely unexplored. Do politicians actually use policies to make politics? Under what conditions? In this paper, we develop a theoretical argument about what can be expected from strategic politicians, and we carry out an empirical analysis on a policy development that is particularly instructive: the adoption of public-sector collective bargaining laws by the states during the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s—laws that fueled the rise of public-sector unions, and “made politics” to the advantage of Democrats over Republicans.

Polarization and Policy: The Politics of Public SectorPensions Anzia, Sarah F., and Terry M. Moe. Forthcoming. “Polarization and Policy: The Politics of Public Sector Pensions.” Legislative StudiesQuarterly . Abstract For decades, America’s state and local governments have promised their workers increasingly generous pensions but failed to fully fund them, producing a fiscal problem of staggering proportions. In this paper, we examine the politics of public pensions. While mainstream theoretical ideas in the American politics literature would suggest the pension issue should be polarized, with Democrats pushing for generous pensions over Republican resistance, we develop an argument—rooted in more traditional theoretical work by Schattschneider, Lowi, Wilson, and others—implying that both parties should be expected to support generous pensions during normal times, and that only after the onset of the Great Recession, which expanded the scope of conflict, should the parties begin to diverge. Using a new dataset of state legislators’ votes on hundreds of pension bills passed between 1999 and 2011, we carry out an empirical analysis that supports these expectations. Public Sector Unions and the Costs ofGovernment Anzia, Sarah F., and Terry M. Moe. 2015. \"Public Sector Unions and the Costs of Government.\" Journal of Politics 77 (1):114-127. Abstract Public sector unions are major interest groups in American politics, but they are rarely studied. New research would not only shed much-needed light on how these unions shape government and politics, but also broaden the way scholars think about interest groups generally: by highlighting interests that arise inside governments, drawing attention to long-ignored types of policies and decision arenas, and underlining the importance of groups in subnational politics. Here we explore the effects of public sector unions on the costs of government. We present two separate studies, using different datasets from different historical periods, and we examine several outcomes: salaries, health benefits, and employment. We find that unions and collective bargaining increase the costs of government, and that the effects are substantively significant. We view this analysis as an opening wedge that we hope will encourage a more extensive line of new research—and new thinking about American interest groups. Collective Bargaining, Transfer Rights, and DisadvantagedSchools Anzia, Sarah F., and Terry M. Moe. 2014. \"Collective Bargaining, Transfer Rights, and Disadvantaged Schools.\" Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis 36 (1):83-111. Abstract Collective bargaining is common in American public education, but its consequences are poorly understood. We focus here on key contractual provisions—seniority-based transfer rights—that affect teacher assignments, and we show that these transfer rights operate to burden disadvantaged schools with higher percentages of inexperienced teachers. We also show that this impact is conditional: It is substantial in large districts, where decisions are likely to follow rules, but it is virtually zero in small districts, where decisions tend to be less formal and undesirable outcomes can more easily be avoided. The negative consequences are thus concentrated on precisely those districts and schools—large districts, high-minority schools—that have been the nation’s worst performers and the most difficult to improve.

Jackman. 2013. \"Legislative Organization and the Second Face of Power: Evidence from U.S. State Legislatures.\" Journal of Politics 75 (1):210-224. Abstract A vast literature argues that the majority party in most legislatures enjoys a policymaking advantage through its access to gatekeeping institutions that let it block bills from reaching the floor. However, agenda-setting institutions vary substantially across legislatures. We propose that this variation should have demonstrable consequences for the majority party’s influence. In this article, we develop hypotheses about the institutional features of legislatures that enable the majority party to block bills. Then, we canvass all 99 U.S. state legislative chambers to measure whether those institutions are present and test whether they lower the rate at which the majority party is rolled. We find that in legislatures where majority-appointed committees can decline to hear bills or decline to report them to the floor, or where the majority leadership can block bills from appearing on the calendar, majority roll rates are significantly lower than in legislatures where those veto points are absent.

Abstract Many governments in the United States hold elections on days other than national Election Day. Recent studies have argued that the low voter turnout that accompanies such off-cycle elections could create an advantage for interest groups. However, the endogeneity of election timing makes it difficult to estimate its causal effect on political outcomes. In this paper, I develop a theoretical framework that explains how changes to election timing affect the electoral fortunes of organized interest groups. I test the theory by examining the effects of a 2006 Texas law that forced approximately 20 percent of the state’s school districts to move their elections to the same day as national elections. Using matching as well as district fixed effects regression, I estimate the causal effect of the switch to on-cycle election timing on district teacher salaries, since teachers and their unions tend to be the dominant interest group in school board elections. I find that school districts that were forced to switch to on-cycle elections responded by granting significantly lower salary raises to teachers, supporting the hypothesis that school trustees were less responsive to the dominant interest group after the switch. Partisan Power Play: The Origins of Local Election Timing as an American PoliticalInstitution Anzia, Sarah F . 2012. \"Partisan Power Play: The Origins of Local Election Timing as an American Political Institution.\" Studies in American Political Development 26 (1):24-49. Abstract Eighty percent of American cities today hold their general elections on different days than state and national elections. It is an established fact that voter turnout in these off-cycle local elections is far lower than turnout in local elections held concurrently with state and national elections. In this paper, I demonstrate that the timing of city elections has been an important determinant of voter turnout since before the Civil War. By examining three large American cities over the course of the nineteenth century, I find that American political parties regularly manipulated the timing of city elections to secure an edge over their rivals. I show that the decisions to change the election dates of these cities were contentious, partisan, and motivated by an expectation of subsequent electoral gain. The Progressive municipal reformers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries continued in this tradition when they separated city elections from state and national elections, and the local election schedule they implemented has largely persisted until today. The Jackie (and Jill) Robinson Effect: Why Do Congresswomen OutperformCongressmen? Anzia, Sarah F ., and Christopher R. Berry. 2011. \"The Jackie (and Jill) Robinson Effect: Why Do Congresswomen Outperform Congressmen?\" American Journal of Political Science 55 (3):478-493. Abstract If voters are biased against female candidates, only the most talented, hardest working female candidates will succeed in the electoral process. Furthermore, if women perceive there to be sex discrimination in the electoral process, or if they underestimate their qualifications for office, then only the most qualified, politically ambitious females will emerge as candidates. We argue that when either or both forms of sex-based selection are present, the women who are elected to office will perform better, on average, than their male counterparts. We test this central implication of our theory by studying the relative success of men and women in delivering federal spending to their districts and in sponsoring legislation. Analyzing changes within districts over time, we find that congresswomen secure roughly 9% more spending from federal discretionary programs than congressmen. Women also sponsor and cosponsor significantly more bills than their male colleagues. Election Timing and the Electoral Influence of InterestGroups Anzia, Sarah F . 2011. \"Election Timing and the Electoral Influence of Interest Groups.\" Journal of Politics 73 (2):412-427. Abstract It is an established fact that off-cycle elections attract lower voter turnout than on-cycle elections. I argue that the decrease in turnout that accompanies off-cycle election timing creates a strategic opportunity for organized interest groups. Members of interest groups with a large stake in an election outcome turn out at high rates regardless of election timing, and their efforts to mobilize and persuade voters have a greater impact when turnout is low. Consequently, policy made by officials elected in off-cycle elections should be more favorable to the dominant interest group in a polity than policy made by officials elected in on-cycle elections. I test this theory using data on school district elections in the United States, in which teacher unions are the dominant interest group. I find that districts with off-cycle elections pay experienced teachers over 3% more than districts that hold on-cycle elections.

       " 'Doug Koshland': \"Doug Koshland Contact Info Richard and Rhoda Goldman Distinguished Chair in the Biological Sciences & Professor of Genetics, Genomics and Development* **And Affiliate, Division of Cell and Developmental Biology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/koshland/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Overview My laboratory uses budding yeast to study fundamental processes in cell biology. Our approach has been to develop novel genetic reagents and cell biological methods to analyze these complex processes in vivo, coupled with the development and exploitation of in vitro assays to reveal underlying molecular mechanisms. Together these approaches have allowed us to make significant contributions to following three areas of research. Higher Order Chromosome Structure is important for the integrity, transmission and expression of chromosomes. The molecular bases for the formation, maintenance and disassembly of higher order chromosome organization are major unsolved problems in cell biology. The Maintenance of Genome Integrity (chromosome number and integrity) is critical to prevent cell inviability, inherited disorders and disease. A major threat to genome integrity is breaks in the DNA that can be misrepaired to cause gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR) such as translocations, internal deletions or terminal truncations. While the cause of DSBs and their repair have been studied intensively, major new discoveries will be required to explain the massive rearrangement of chromosomes associated with cancer. Stress Tolerance is fundametnal to an organisms ability to survive internal and environmental perturbations. We study stress response through the lens of desiccation tolerance, a remarkable trait found in rare species in all kingdoms of life. Desiccation tolerance has significant biomedical potential and will likely provide novel insights into the role of different cell biological processes in water homeostasis. Current Projects Chromosome Structure Higher order chromosome structure is important for transcription, chromosome segregation and DNA repair. Higher order chromosome structure is mediated by a conserved set of protein complexes called SMC for structural maintenance of chromosomes. These SMC complexes provide a powerful platform to understand both the biological function and molecular basis for different types of higher order chromosome structure. SMC complexes facilitate higher order organization of chromosomes by their ability to tether together two different regions of DNA, either within the same chromosome or between different chromosomes My laboratory has shown that different types of higher order chromosome organization are coordinated because the function of SMC complexes are highly interdependent. Different SMC complexes interact in at least three distinct ways to mediate proper chromosome morphogenesis in mitosis, meiosis and DNA repair. They regulate each other's assembly on chromosomes, regulate each other's disassembly from chromosomes and cooperate to build other chromosomal structures like synaptonemal complex. However, what is the molecular basis for the tethering activity of SMC complexes and how this activity is modulated by regulatory modifications of the complex or auxillary factors remain unanswered. To address these two questions we have studied a prototypic SMC complex, cohesin. The tethering activity of cohesin is used for sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome condensation, DNA repair and regulation of gene expression, including studies implicating a potential role in stem cell gene expression. We have shown that cohesins bind chromatin and then become cohesive. We also have shown that this conversion to the cohesive state is regulated by complex post-translational modifications in response to cell cycle and DNA damage. Our understanding of cohesin regulation allows us to lock cohesin in either the non-cohesive or cohesive-competent state, providing critical new tools to facilitate poweful genetic suppressor studies, to assess specificity of in vitro activities as well as to generate sufficient quantities of active complex for in depth biochemical and structure studies. Our current genetic, molecular, biochemical and imaging studies of cohesin and its regulation have revealed novel roles for cohesin ATPase function, cohesin acetylation and cohesin oligomerization that dramatically reshape current models for the molecular mechanism by which cohesin modulates chromosome structure. In collaboration with the Meyer lab, we are leveraging the genetic tools developed to study cohesin in budding yeast to interogate in metazoans the roles of its tethering and oligomerization activities in sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression. Genome Integrity Dissecting the molecular basis for chromosome integrity is challenging because changes in chromosome integrity like GCRs (Gross Chromosomal Rearrangement) are usually rare and often either lethal or genetically silent.To identify novel processes that prevent GCR, we developed a high throughput assay to follow GCR using a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). Our studies identified novel proteins required to promote chromosome integrity. As one example, we find that factors required for general mRNA metabolism play an active role in masking newly formed RNA molecules to prevent them from hybridizing back to DNA. When RNA-DNA hybrids do form, two evolutionarily conserved RNases H acts as a surveillance mechanism for their removal, thereby safeguarding the genome. We have shown that hybrids form in trans (that is RNA hybridizes to homologous DNA sequences distinct from their site of synthesis), catalyzed by the homologous DNA repair machinery. Fundamental questions remain unaswered including: 1) where do hybrids form in the genome?; 2) why are there two RNAses H and what are their roles in hybrid removal; 3) what type of DNA damage is induced by hybrids, and 4) what are the repair mechanisms of hybrid induced damage? To address these questions, we have developed new genetic and molecular reagents in yeast including a novel genome-wide mapping methods of hybrids. These tools have defined causal elements for hybrid formation, revealed distinct spacial functions of the RNAses H, and implicated hybrids not only in damge formation but also modulating DNA repair. Stress Tolerance through the Lens of Desiccation Tolerance Studies of biological extremes have transformed biology, for example the study of telomeres in tetrahymena, the giant axons of squids, or the identfication thermo-resistant polymerases in thermophiles. With this precedent in mind, we study desiccation tolerance in yeast as mechanism to provide novel insights into water homeostasis and stress biology. Two fundamental questions about desiccation tolerance remain unanswered. What is the stress(es) that kill desiccation sensitive cells and how do tolerant cells mitigate these stresses to survive. While the rare trait of desiccation has been studied for many years, almost all studies have succeeded in establishing only correlations (for example the presence of specific small molecules like special sugars or peptides) without any means of testing causality. Indeed, desiccation tolerance has been correlated with a number of stress response pathways including, heat shock, osmotic, DNA damage or high-salt. We have estalbished budding yeast as a genetic model to study desiccation tolerance and demonstrated that the lethal stresses of desiccation are likely protein aggregation and membrane damage, and not salt, oxydation, DNA damage or osmotic stresses as previously proposed. Hugo Tapia has shown that the small sugar trehalose plays a profound causal role in desiccation tolerance in part by mitigating these stresses. These exciting new observations identify critical desiccation tolerant factors and connect them with the propagation of amyloids, associated with a number of human diseases. We are currently investigating the role of small intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) as stress protectors. Intrinsically disordered proteins and domains represent a huge unexplored proportion of the proteome. Thus the study of IDPs in desiccation tolerance provides a powerful tool to unlock the mysteries of their biological and molecular functions.

       " 'Michael Marletta': 'Michael Marletta Contact Info Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology* *and Professor of Chemistry Lab Homepage: http://www.marlettalab.org/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Questions under investigation in our laboratory lie at the interface of chemistry and biology with a particular emphasis on the study of protein function and enzyme reaction mechanisms and a focus on molecular answers to complex functions in biology. Current projects include nitric oxide signaling (including aspects of S-nitrosation) in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, molecular mechanisms of gas sensing, and mechanisms and functions of polysaccharide monooxygenses. Current Projects NO Signaling and gas sensing The lab has had a long-standing interest in nitric oxide (NO) function in biology. We have brought chemical thinking to bear on how a reactive and toxic molecule like NO functions selectively in biological responses such as blood vessel dilation, central nervous system signaling and signaling in prokaryotes. We have uncovered many aspects of NO function including key elements of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase and the receptor for NO, the soluble isoform of guanylate cyclase (sGC). Our continued studies on NO signaling have led to a more general molecular understanding of gas sensing mechanisms in biology. Molecular questions on how the heme in sGC is able to capture NO in competition with the much more abundant oxygen led to the discovery of a novel family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic hemoprotein sensor proteins that have been termed H-NOX proteins (Heme-Nitric oxide OXygen). Some bacterial H-NOXs have ligand properties identical to sGC and some form stable complexes with oxygen, CO and NO. With John Kuriyan, H-NOX structures were solved that led to the key molecular determinants for ligand discrimination against oxygen. Since then we have solved many more structures, including recent electron microscopy views of nitric oxide synthase and sGC. The ability to link structure to ligand specificity has allowed us to discover novel sGCs regulated by oxygen, oxygen sensing in C. elegans , decipher an NO-dependent two-component signaling pathway in prokaryotes involved in biofilm formation, and other aspects of H-NOX function in biology. H-NOX signaling in pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae is a current focus of study. Polysaccharide Monooxygenases The lab has recently investigated cellulose degradation with the hope of getting past a long-standing bottleneck in producing biofuels from feedstock. We assumed organisms that efficiently degrade cellulose such as the fungus Neurospora, must have an enzyme repertoire beyond those that utilize hydrolytic general acid and base catalysis. Using transcriptomics, knockouts, and quantitative proteomics, we discovered a new class of copper-dependent hydroxylases, termed polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs), which play a significant role in cellulose degradation. Structure and function relationships are currently under study. In addition, PMOs have been found in fungal and bacterial pathogens as well as some thought to be involved in development. Study of these novel PMOs is underway. Selected Publications Vu, V., Beeson, W.T., Phillips, C.M., Cate, J.H.D. and Marletta, M.A. (2014).

       " 'Richard Harland': \"Richard Harland Contact Info Senior Associate Dean of Biological Sciences, C.H. Li Distinguished  Professor of Genetics, Genomics and Development Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/harland/ Full Directory Information Research Interests The objective of our work is to understand early vertebrate development at the molecular level. We study this problem in both the amphibian Xenopus , and in the mouse. Xenopus embryos are large and easily manipulated, so that the function of various macromolecules, such as RNA and protein, can be assayed by microinjection into living embryos. Functional assays in Xenopus can then be complemented by genetic knockouts in the mouse, to gain fuller understanding of the normal requirements for gene action in the developing embryo. Current Projects Axis formation, induction and patterning of the Neural Plate: The dorsal-ventral organization of the gastrula arises from a series of symmetry breaking steps, including the activation of early Wnt/beta catenin signaling, which synergizes with Nodal/Smad2 signaling to generate Spemann’s Organizer. Where Smad2 and beta-catenin signals overlap, the Organizer genes are expressed, and several of these are BMP antagonists, which prevent ventral BMP signals from inducing epidermis and ventral mesoderm, and allow, by default, the formation of the nervous system and dorsal mesoderm. At the same time the nervous system becomes patterned in the anterior posterior axis to form brain and spinal cord, with the default fate being brain, and spinal cord being induced by a combination of Fibroblast Growth Factor and a re-use of Wnt/beta catenin signaling ( 1 ). To identify new signaling mechanisms, we developed methods to screen libraries of mRNAs to identify potent bioactivities, such as molecules that dorsalize the embryo ( 2 ). We then use explants to study how these signals determine the state of tissues at different times- when and how do these tissues become specified to form epidermis and nervous system, for example, in response to these signals; we also determine the biochemical mechanism for the activity. Noggin is one such molecule, which binds tightly to the BMPs and prevents them from signaling ( 3 ). Shape changes in development: In addition to the molecules that determine cell fates, we are also interested in the cellular mechanisms that enable embryonic tissues to form the shape and organization of the tadpole. We showed that the Planar Cell Polarity pathway, originally studied in Drosophila, is also used in the frog gastrula, when the simple organization of the cleaving embryo rearranges to form the three germ layers of ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm ( 4 ). This pathway continues to operate to elongate the tadpole, and along with the rolling up of the neural plate ( 5 ), is an important part of extending and closing the neural tube. Genetics and Genomics of Xenopus: While Xenopus laevis , the South African Clawed frog, remains an ideal model to combine experimental manipulations of tissues, because of the large size of the embryo, and tolerance to injections and microsurgery, we have complemented this work with the use of the Western Clawed Frog, Xenopus tropicalis , which has a simpler, diploid genome, smaller size and more rapid development, all of which enable us to raise frogs quickly to exploit manipulations of the genes and genomes, in both forward and reverse genetic screens ( 6-8 ). Both X. laevis and X. tropicalis are well suited to genome-wide approaches, and because of the large size of the embryo, we can isolate sufficient RNAs or proteins from just a few embryos for systems-level analysis. To facilitate this approach, we have collaborated with our colleague Dan Rokhsar and others to sequence and assemble the genome of X. tropicalis ( 9 ), and are completing the assembly of the X. laevis genome; we are continuing this approach with other frogs, so that we can contribute well-annotated and complete genomes for work with different frogs. We have used these assembled genomes to study the contribution of individual splicing factors to the organized maturation of messenger RNAs ( 10 ), and in other current projects, are using the assembled genomes to study the activation of gene expression by Wnt/beta catenin signaling during formation of the spinal cord and neural crest ( 11 ). BMP antagonists in Mouse Development: To understand the role of BMP signaling and its attenuation in mammalian development, we have made mutants in BMP antagonists in the mouse. BMP signaling is used in many contexts, and the potent activity must be blocked in many developmental events to permit normal development ( 12 ). We have recently been most interested in the activity of overlapping BMP antagonists in development of the axial skeleton, where BMP signaling must first be prevented to allow formation of the skeletal precursors, and then permitted to permit the differentiation of these precursors ( 13 ). BMP signaling must also be attenuated in the formation of the gut, where excess BMP signaling eliminated cells that control the smooth muscle activity and in a separate process prevents proper maturation of the stem cells of the intestinal crypts.

I hold a B.A. in history (1982, University of Toronto), an M.B.A. (1985, University of Toronto), and a Ph.D. in organizational behavior and industrial relations (1990, University of California, Berkeley). I worked at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business from 1990 to 1994, at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management from 1994 to 1999, and Columbia University's Graduate School of Business from 1998 to 2007. I joined U.C. Berkeley in July 2006. I study how organizations, the fields in which they are embedded, and the careers of their members and employees evolve. I investigate questions that relate to organizational stability and change: How do new kinds of organizations emerge and how do new industries develop? How strong are the forces that impel or inhibit change in existing organizations' structures, strategies, and actions? What are the consequences of organizational change for organizations themselves and for their employees? How does industry evolution affect social structures? My current work involves American magazines, U.S. wineries, Chinese listed firms, and the emerging marijuana market in several U.S. states.

       " 'Judith Innes': 'Judith E. Innes Professor Emerita of City & Regional Planning Specializations Planning Theory; Planning Process, Collaborative Planning; Research Methods; Urban Social Structure and Equity; Water Policy; Transportation Policy; Metropolitan Governance. Education Ph.D. Urban Studies and Planning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology B.A. English Literature, Harvard College Biography Judith Innes holds a Ph.D. from MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning and an undergraduate degree in English from Harvard University. Her dissertation and first book looked at theory and practice of social indicators use in public policy. She has done research on the processes of planning and decision making across a wide range of substantive topics, including land use and environmental policy, water management, growth management, transportation, human rights, environmental justice and social policy. Her recent interests have focused on collaborative policy making and action at the state and regional levels. She maintains a continuing interest in how to improve the use of information in planning and public policy. She taught planning theory for many years, developing ideas through her research on communicative planning. She believes that the next agenda for planning thought and planning practice must be about how to address contemporary challenges to the traditional institutions and practices of decision making and how to develop new concepts of governance to deal with collaboration and with the many voices and competing versions of reality that confront planners today. Her most recent book, Planning with Complexity: An Introduction to Collaborative Rationality for Public Policy (Routledge/Taylor and Francis, Oxford), with David E. Booher, outlines a new theory and approach to planning. Professor Innes’ teaching spanned courses in land use and environmental policy, urban social structure and processes in the multiethnic city, research methods for master\\'s students and for doctoral students, introduction to planning practice, organizational behavior in government agencies, land use studios, indicators for policy and planning, contemporary theory of planning, and methods of negotiation and collaboration. Her most recent course was on metropolitan governance and planning. From 1993 through 2003, Dr. Innes was the director of the Institute of Urban& Regional Development , a campus-wide organized research unit addressing a wide range of topics through externally funded faculty and student research. In her capacity as director she also directed the Community Partnerships office (former the University Oakland Metropolitan Forum) and was involved in managing a variety of community development efforts, action research, and community-based learning projects in partnership with localities, foundations and NGO’s. She is author, editor or coauthor of more than 50 articles and book chapters, four books and two major monographs. Her articles have been translated into Chinese, French, Italian, and Korean. She has given presentations on her research in countries around the world.

       " 'W. Martin': 'W. Mike Martin Professor Emeritus of Architecture Education Ph.D. Architecture, University of California, Berkeley M.Arch., University of Washington B.Arch., University of Colorado Philosophy Statement As architects, what we design and build lasts for a very long period of time ï¿½ therefore, we must add value, however broadly defined, to our clients, users of buildings, and our communities. We use design as our primary skill and knowledge base that differentiates our profession from others. Our use of the term ï¿½designï¿½ is defined as more than aesthetic or novel invention; it is broader and inclusive of creative thought and innovation. Design innovation that is of value transforms both building performance and human behavior. For most, that is an easy aspiration but a difficult achievement. A quiet revolution is underway to address these challenges. At the core of this gentle revolution is the use of transparent evidence to inform our decisions as designers and restructure the way we practice as a means of ensuring design quality. Biography Professor Emeritus W. Mike Martin was at UC Berkeley for 18 years in the Architecture Department of the College of Environmental Design. His teaching and research has focused on the study of practice, collaborative design, work-studies of practice, and storytelling as a means of knowledge transfer. Digital media is central to his process of representation of knowledge transfer from practice. Martin served as an Adjunct Professor at the Danish Royal Academy of Architecture in Copenhagen, Denmark, and a Visiting Professor at DIS. He also served as the undergraduate dean of CED for 11 years, and in 2006 he completed a three-year term as chair of the Architecture Department. Most recently, he served as the University of California Systems Education Abroad Director for Scandinavia. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and a recipient of the 2005 AIA College of Fellows Latrobe Fellowship for Research. He was the recipient of the 2009 AIACC Excellence in Education Honor Award. He served as President Elect of the San Francisco Chapter of the AIA, served as editor of Architecture California (AIACC), and received an Honorable Mention in the 2002 NCARB Prize for his Building Stories: A Case Study Analysis of Practice.

Genetics  McGill University, 1969 PMB Head Graduate Student Advisor Research Agrobacterium and Plasmodesmata Our laboratory performs research in two distinct areas. In microbial biology we study the molecular mechanisms utilized by Agrobacterium that leads to the genetic transformation of plant cells. In plant biology we study how plant cells communicate with each other via unique plant specific intercellular structures called plasmodesmata. 1. Agrobacterium mediated DNA transfer to plant cells. A specific DNA segment, T-DNA, is transferred from a large bacterial plasmid across bacterial and plant cell membranes and ultimately integrates stably into the plant nuclear genome. We study Agrobacterium-specific proteins and their respective molecular mechanisms responsible for producing a DNA-protein complex capable of plant cell transformation. Current research is aimed at defining the topology of the bacterial export channel. This channel is the paradigm for type IV secretion systems (T4SS). T4SS are utilized by plant and animal pathogens to transport DNA as well as protein toxins that manipulate their respective host cells to cause disease. A model of how the 12 proteins (VirB1-B11, VirD4) essential for T4SS form a membrane-spanning channel is presented in Figure 1. The T-DNA is transferred as a single stranded intermediate called the T-strand. In addition, 4 proteins, VirD2, VirE2, VirE3, and VirF are exported by the T4SS to plant cells. This model was predicted by genetic and bioinformatics approaches. Current efforts aim to define the topology, location and function of the T4SS. We have recently determined that the multiple T4SS localize in a periodic (potentially) helical pattern around the circumference of the bacterial cell.This localization pattern was determined by deconvolution fluorescence microscopy of GFP fusions to T4SS components and substrates. Figure 2 shows several optical sections through the bacterial cell. This localization pattern was confirmed by immuno-fluorescence microscopy of native T4SS proteins. This localization pattern likely facilitates binding of Agrobacterium to susceptible plant cells.Indeed, if one tags the T4SS with GFP, one can see Agrobacterium binding laterally along their lengths to single plant cells. (Figure 2). We now are investigating what constitutive bacterial components facilitate T4SS localization. We reasoned that the T4SS may either use an existing periodic/helical scaffold for its assembly, such as the bacterial cytoskeleton, or it may take advantage of interruptions in the bacterial cell wall (peptidogylcan) that occur during bacterial cell elongation. Recent studies suggest both hypotheses are correct and converge on the specific mechanisms underlying the determination of Agrobacterium cell shape. In addition we are determining the role of the extracellular T-pilus (colored in yellow Figure 1) in mediating plant cell contact and substrate transport. 2. Plasmodesmata structure and function. Plasmodesmata (PD) are channels that span the plant cell wall, linking the cytoplasm between adjacent cells. These channels are highly dynamic, and impact on all levels of plant growth from general responses to the environment to defense against pathogens. Figure 5 shows that generic PD consist of membranes and spaces. The outer limits of PD are defined by the plasma membrane which is contiguous between two cells. The axial center of PD (called the desmotubule) is defined by endoplasmic reticulum between adjacent cells. The space between the desmotubule and the plasma membrane is called the cytoplasmic sleeve, and represents the contiguous cytoplasm between adjacent cells. Our laboratory is interested in defining the factors that regulate PD structure and function that are localized at the entrance and along the length of the channel. We have developed a genetic screen using embryo defective lines of Arabidopsis and have several candidate mutants that define genes that affect PD aperture during mid embryogenesis. We are also studying the innate capacity of plant embryos to traffic proteins cell to cell via PD. Different sized derivatives of green fluorescent protein (GFP) were initially expressed in meristematic regions of the embryo. Subsequent movement of encoded proteins from their site of synthesis then reveals PD aperture. 1X sized GFP moves throughout all regions of the embryo. 2X sized GFP cannot move to the embryonic leaves, and 3X sized GFP cannot move to the tip of the root. Thus, different regions of the embryo contain PD with different apertures that likely regulate the movement of critical regulators of development (Figure 6). We have identified the genes in two mutants with increased intercellular transport during embryogenesis, called increased size exclusion limit 1 (ise1) and ise2. ISE1 encodes a mitochondrial localized DEAD box RNA helicase, and ISE2 encodes a DEVH box RNA helicase that localizes to chloroplasts. Whole genome expression analyses reveal that nuclear genes encoding plastid specific products are overwhelmingly down regulated in both ise1 and ise2 mutants (genes down regulated in both mutants are shown in red in Figure 7A). In fact, both mutants affect plastid development and cause leaf chlorosis (Figure 7B). These data imply extensive crosstalk among mitochondria, plastids, and nuclei. Since both mutantsshowincreased de novo production of plasmodesmata, these expression analyses further imply that organelle-nuclear signaling affects plasmodesmata formation and function. While mitochondrial-nuclear or plastid-nuclear signaling are established and known retrograde signaling pathways, we have uncovered a novel pathway, dubbed organelle-nucleus-plasmodesmata signaling (ONPS)(Figure 7C). Independent analyses of redox states in mitochondria versus plastids confirm that organelle homeostasis affects plasmodesmata transport.Ongoing research aims to uncover genes and signals that regulate ONPS and de novo plasmodesmata synthesis.

He received his Master of Architecture degree from Princeton University. Biography Christopher Calott, AIA, ULI, LF ‘12, is an award-winning architect, urban designer, academic and real estate developer. He is a principal at CALOTT + GIFFORD Architecture / Urban Design and a founding partner of the real estate development firm INFILL SOLUTIONS: Innovative Urban Design and Development. His two firms work together to create innovative regional urban typologies in mixed-use urban housing, dense infill developments, affordable housing, transit-oriented development, and vibrant public plazas in the Southwest, often working with urban Native American populations and traditional Hispanic communities in the region. His architectural firm, CALOTT + GIFFORD Architecture / Urban Design and his closely connected real estate development firm INFILL SOLUTIONS: Innovative Urban Design and Development have produced numerous projects which create urban design solutions and employ dense urban building typologies using modern forms in mixed-use urban infill developments, and affordable housing operating principally throughout the American Southwest. He has also pursued significant research in the areas of urbanism, housing, and community-based design practices through published investigations tied to teaching appointments at numerous universities throughout the United States, Mexico, and Latin America. Fast Company magazine recognized CALOTT + GIFFORD’s award-winning design practice in 2011 as one of the “50 brilliant urbanites helping to build the cities of American’s future”. By working as both the architect and developer his practice has challenged conventional zoning, financing strategies and modes of development. His innovative work has introduced new mixed-use housing types, dense “infill” subdivisions, Transit-Oriented Development, Community Supported Agriculture, affordable housing, and vibrant public plazas, places and public art. His commitment to design excellence has transformed non-profit affordable housing and publicly financed urban design projects, often working with urban Native American populations and traditional Hispanic communities in the Southwest. Calott’s longstanding work and research on informal urbanization patterns and social justice issues at the US-Mexico Borderlands resulted in FRONTERA / BORDER: 7th Consurso Internacional ARQUINE, an international design Congress convened in Mexico City. Chris received a Loeb Fellowship at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design in 2011-2012, where he spent the year in residence investigating affordable housing delivery mechanisms, urban design theories, Landscape Urbanism, and Green Infrastructure design strategies. These topics coincide with the work he has pursued throughout his professional and academic career.

Architecture, Princeton University Philosophy Statement Architecture is a complex engagement between people and the things which surround them. The architect's task is to make places and buildings that nurture and enrich that engagement, bringing imaginative, critical, responsible thought to the making of things - so that they will stand, stir, accommodate, intrigue, sustain attention, and take a rightful place in people's lives. Biography Professor Lyndon's work as an architect, author and educator concerned with the design of places has been widely recognized. While at CED he was a member of the Graduate Group for the Design of Urban Places and taught in both the Architecture and Master of Urban Design programs. He is the Editor of PLACES, a journal of environmental design. Books he has written include The Sea Ranch (with Jim Alinder) and The City Observed: Boston. He has co-authored Chambers for a Memory Palace and The Place of Houses . He serves on the Boards of the International Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Design, in Italy and of the Charles Moore Center for the Study of Place in Austin TX. He is Chair of the Board of Directors for the Kronos Performing Arts Association and has served as a member of the Architectural Advisory Board for the US State Department's Office of Overseas Building Operations. His architectural and urban design practice includes a continuing series of works at Sea Ranch in Norther California. In 1965, with the firm Moore Lyndon Turnbull Whitaker, he designed Condominium One, which received the distinguished AIA 25 Year Award and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He has been the architect for projects throughout the US. His urban design practice has included plans for Pasadena, Menlo Park and Berkeley; including the Bayer Bio tech campus and the Downtown Public Improvements Master Plan for Berkeley. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, has received numerous design awards and serves regularly on architectural competition juries.

Nervous systems contain\\r\\nmany different cell types. One way to generate this diversity is for\\r\\nneuroblasts to divide asymmetrically, producing daughter cells that adopt\\r\\ndistinct fates. We have identified several proteins that function in specific\\r\\nneuroblasts that divide asymmetrically to generate an apoptotic cell and a\\r\\nneuron or neural precursor. These proteins regulate the position of the\\r\\nneuroblast spindle and the distribution of developmental potential to daughter\\r\\ncells. Our current focus is to understand how Frizzleds, cell surface receptors\\r\\nfor Wnt glycoproteins, orient these divisions and how membrane trafficking\\r\\nevents regulate the function of Frizzled receptors. Neuronal polarity and\\r\\nmigrations. When neurons are born,\\r\\nthey often migrate to new positions where they differentiate. These migrations\\r\\nshape nervous system structure. Once in their final positions, neurons polarize\\r\\nand extend an axonal growth cone that navigates to reach its synaptic targets.\\r\\nThe establishment of polarity and the ability of axons to find their targets\\r\\nare essential steps in establishing the connections between neurons that\\r\\nunderlies behavior. We are studying molecules that orient the polarity and\\r\\nguide the migrations of these neurons and their growth cones along the C.\\r\\nelegans anterior/posterior (A/P)\\r\\naxis. Polarity and guidance\\r\\nalong the A/P axis appears to be regulated by the activity of several molecules\\r\\nthat interact to orient neuronal polarity and guide migrating cells and growth\\r\\ncones. VAB-8, a novel kinesin-like protein orients polarity of neurons toward\\r\\nthe posterior and promotes directed cell and growth cone migrations toward the\\r\\nposterior of the animal. VAB-8, acting with the conserved Rac exchange factor\\r\\nUNC-73/Trio, increases levels of the receptors that promote posterior polarity\\r\\nand guidance. We are particularly interested in defining the mechanism of how\\r\\nVAB-8L and UNC-73 control the levels and distributions of these receptors. Wnts, secreted glycoproteins\\r\\nthat function in several different developmental processes, act antagonistically\\r\\nto VAB-8, orienting the polarity of neurons toward the anterior and guiding the\\r\\nanterior migrations of C. elegans cells\\r\\nand growth cones. The effects of the Wnts are mediated by Frizzled receptors.\\r\\nWnts and Frizzleds also act to guide growth cones along the mammalian spinal\\r\\ncord, but how Frizzled receptors transduce their signals in neuronal polarity\\r\\nand axon guidance is unclear. We are using genetic approaches to define these\\r\\nintracellular signaling pathways. Axon\\r\\nfasciculation . In C. elegans , growth cones extend along\\r\\nspecific axons to generate highly ordered nerve bundles or fascicles. We have\\r\\nrecently begun a project to develop methods to detect these specific axon-axon\\r\\ninteractions and to perturb specific interactions using RNA interference\\r\\ntechniques.

Profile My research interests concern religious practice, media technologies, and emergent forms of political community in the Middle East, North America, and Europe. I give particular attention to diverse configurations of the human sensorium, and the histories, ethics, and politics they make possible. Taking contemporary developments within the traditions of Islam as my primary focus, I have explored how various religious practices and institutions have been revised and renewed both by modern norms of social and political life, and by the styles of consumption and culture linked to global mass media practices. My first book, The Ethical Soundscape: Cassette Sermons and Islamic Counterpublics (Columbia 2006), explores how a popular Islamic media form-the cassette sermon-has profoundly transformed the political geography of the Middle East over the last three decades. My more recent project is a study of the different ways in which Europe's Islamic past inhabits its present, unsettling contemporary efforts to secure Europe's Christian civilizational identity. Taking southern Spain as my focus, I explore the forms of history and memory that mediate and sustain an active relation to Europe's Islamic heritage, and the impact these forms have on the ethical and political possibilities of finding a place for Islam in Europe today.

Education M.Arch., Advanced Studies in Architecture, Massachusetts Institute of Technology B.Arch., Tulane University Philosophy Statement Architects establish in their designs a frame for our daily lives, a setting that reflects culture, region, and place; that contributes to our well-being as building occupants; and - of principal concern to me - a frame that shapes patterns of energy use. As physical objects our buildings often perform poorly, waste energy, dissatisfy occupants, and form a less than satisfactory architectural whole. We can do better and efforts to do so produce a more interesting architecture. Biography Professor Benton has lectured and published extensively on topics of curriculum development, field evaluation methods, thermal comfort, and daylighting. He has received two Progressive Architecture Research Awards and an AIA Education Honors Honorable Mention. Professor Benton teaches courses in the areas of energy and environmental management, daylighting, technology transfer, field evaluation of building performance, and documentary photography. Current research interests include field investigation of thermal comfort, visualization of sunlight and shadow patterns, and post-occupancy measurement of physical building performance. As an Artist-in-Residence at the Exploratorium , Professor Benton combines novel techniques for aerial photography and new media to develop readings of several transitional geographies along San Francisco Bay - in ways that juxtapose scales, collect different points of view, and encourage the sharing of ideas.

Two classes of devices are very important in this regard: fuel cells and rechargeable batteries. Our research group studies the fundamental properties and behavior of electrodes employed in high-performance rechargeable batteries and fuel cells. We synthesize and characterize new electrode materials in order to gain a fundamental understanding of the relationships among atomic and electronic structure, electrochemical performance, and long-term stability. We investigate fundamental means of enhancing material utilization and stability through modifications in the composition and structure of the electrodes, thereby increasing cell specific energy and lifetime. The performance of electrodes employed in fuel cells that directly oxidize such fuels as methanol and ethanol is typically limited by slow electrochemical kinetics. The goals of our research performed on these electrodes are to synthesize new highly active electrocatalysts and characterize their kinetic and mechanistic behavior. By doing this, we identify electrocatalysts, electrode structures, and electrolyte compositions that lead to improved cell performance and lifetime. We rely heavily upon the use of advanced research tools, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS) using synchrotron radiation (in collaboration with Prof. S. Cramer of UC Davis), to characterize the atomic and electronic properties of new electrode materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has been extended (in collaboration with Prof. J. Reimer of UCB) to the study of electronically conducting electrode materials. This powerful technique is used for the atomic-level study of electrode materials for both batteries and fuel cells. We have developed the capability of obtaining the NMR spectra in situ of carbon-containing adsorbates in submonolayer coverages on fuel cell electrocatalysts. We have also pioneered the use of photothermal deflection spectroscopy for the in situ characterization of electrochemical systems.

       " 'Teresa Caldeira': 'Teresa  Caldeira Chair and Professor of City & Regional Planning Specializations Comparative urban studies, urbanization in the global south, social theory, ethnography and qualitative methodology. Education Ph.D. Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley M.A. Political Science, University of São Paulo B.A. Social Sciences, University of São Paulo Biography Teresa Caldeira’s research focuses on the predicaments of urbanization, such as spatial segregation, social discrimination, and the uses of public space in cities of the global south.She has been studying the relationships between urban form and political transformation, particularly in the context of democratization. Her work is interdisciplinary, combining methodologies, theories, and approaches from the different social sciences, the humanities, and the design disciplines. She has been especially concerned with reshaping ethnographic methods for the study of cities. Teresa Caldeira’s book City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in São Paulo (University of California Press, 2000), won the Senior Book Prize of the American Ethnological Society in 2001 and has been translated into Portuguese and Spanish. The book presents a comprehensive analysis of the ways in which crime, fear of violence, and disrespect of citizenship rights intertwine with urban transformations to produce a new pattern of urban segregation based on fortified enclaves. Focusing on São Paulo and using comparative data on Los Angeles, City of Walls suggests that the new pattern of urban segregation developing in these cities also appears in many metropolises around the world. It proposes that the built environment may be the arena in which the contestation of democratization, social equalization, and expansion of citizenship rights is materially embodied in contemporary societies. Teresa Caldeira’s three current research projects seek to investigate new formations of urban life and city space as they intersect with new technologies of the public, new forms of governance, and new paradigms of urban planning. The first project examines a diverse range of public practices and artistic interventions including graffiti and pixação (tagging), rap, massive demonstrations by minority movements and religious groups, poetry readings, skateboarding, parkour, and motorcycling, that are transforming cities and their public spaces around the world. They articulate anew the profound social inequalities that have always marked these cities and create new modes of using the city. Based on many years of ethnographic research in São Paulo, she argues that these practices, both as artistic productions and urban performances, not only give the subaltern classes new visibility in the city and transform the character of public space but also express highly contradictory forms of political action. They affirm rights to the city while fracturing the public with aggressiveness and expose discrimination while refusing integration. Thus they require new conceptualizations of democratic public space and of the role of citizens in producing the city. The second research project focuses on peripheral urbanization in the global south. It analyzes and theorizes auto-construction, acknowledging that cities around the world have been largely constructed by their residents, who build not only their own houses but also their neighborhoods. This long-term process involves interaction with state institutions and capitalist markets but in transversal ways. Residents prepare plans but escape the framing of official planning. They utilize mechanisms of land purchase, consumption, and even credit, but bypass the logics of formal real estate, finance, and commodity circulation. While building houses and cities they make themselves into citizens and political agents, become fluent in rights talk, and claim the city as their own. The third project is a collaboration with Gautam Bhan, from the Indian Institute for Human Settlement; Kelly Gillespie, from the department of anthropology, University of Witwatersrand; and AbdouMaliq Simone, from the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. The project focuses on four metropolises to the global south -- São Paulo, New Delhi, Johannesburg, and Jakarta – to explore the emergence of surprising new forms of collective life. Their protagonists are a new generation of urbanites who are not migrants but are city-born. Coming of age under democracy and with access to information and consumption unimaginable to previous generations, they demonstrate new and complex relationships with the city and urban citizenship. The new arrangements they create are transforming everyday life, urban spaces, gender relations, and urban politics of many cities across the south.

He went on to the Rutgers University in 1977 and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1983. Then he did his postdoctoral research at the University of Washington in Seattle until 1986 when he went to Fermilab as an Associate Scientist. Professor Luk came to UC Berkeley/LBL in 1989. He received the R.R. Wilson Fellow of Fermilab in 1986-1989; won the Department of Energy Outstanding Junior Investigator award in 1989-1991; received the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow in 1990-1994; a Miller Professor in the Fall of 2001; recipient of the Panofsky Prize in 2014, and a fellow of the American Physical Society. Research Interests I have diverse interest in exploring the nature of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions using different kinds of instrumentation and techniques. My current research focusses on the neutrinos and nucleon decay. Daya Bay There are compelling evidences for neutrino oscillation. Flavor oscillations between three kinds of neutrino are completely described by three mixing angles, two mass-squared differences, and one CP-violating phase. CP violation in the lepton sector, if exists, might explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the present Universe. Yet whether the CP-violating effect can be studied with neutrinos or not is dictated by the then unknown mixing angle θ 13 . The primary goal of the Daya Bay experiment in China is to determine the value of θ 13 by measuring the change in flux and distortion of the energy spectrum of the electron antineutrinos originated from six reactors in the Daya Bay nuclear power complex with three sets of detectors located underground at different locations that are within 2 km from the reactors. Daya Bay discovered in 2012 that θ 13 is relatively large. This finding has enabled the future search for CP violation in neutrino oscillation and determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy. DUNE The primary goals of DUNE are to resolve the mass hierarchy problem and hunt for CP violation in the neutrino sector. With an intense muon-neutrino beam sent from Fermilab near Chicago, rare neutrino interactions are detected with four huge time projection chambers, each filled with 10-kt of liquid argon. These massive detectors will be located deep underground in the Sanford Underground Research Facility, South Dakota. Besides studying the neutrinos, the large detectors with excellent tracking capability and energy resolution are ideal for searching for nucleon decay and other rare processes. Publications F.P.

Approaches include biophysics and biochemistry of the process, molecular biology and genetics of the organisms, and scale ups for product generation. Applied aspects include diverting the flow of photosynthesis to generate high-value compounds instead of the normally produced sugars. Products of interest are biofuels, feedstock for the synthetic chemistry industry and pharmaceuticals. Our trademark is product generation directly from photosynthesis, bypassing the need to harvest and process the respective biomass. Research Photosynthetic Biofuels and Chemicals Expertise and Philosophy The expertise of the Melis lab is in the field of photosynthesis and metabolism. We work with land plants, microalgae, cyanobacteria, and non-oxygenic (anaerobic) photosynthetic bacteria. Our platform includes most aspects of photosynthesis, beginning with organism cultivation, the efficiency of light absorption and utilization, electron transport and biochemical energy generation, and chloroplast and cellular metabolism. Included are the biophysics and biochemistry of the process, the molecular biology and genetics of the organisms, as well as scale ups in the cultivation of the various organisms for product generation. The concept of “Photosynthetic Biofuels”, envisioned and pioneered by us, entails the direct application of photosynthesis for the generation of fuels and related chemicals, in a process where a single organism acts both as catalyst and processor, synthesizing and secreting ready to use commodity products. The lab contributed with a breakthrough in the field, when in 2000 we demonstrated, for the first time, how to divert the natural flow of photosynthesis in green microalgae and to sustainably generate hydrogen gas, instead of the normally produced oxygen. This technology is currently employed by many laboratories in several countries, and serves as the platform for further photobiological hydrogen production research in the field. The Melis lab also pioneered and currently leads an international effort to improve, by up to 300%, the efficiency and productivity of photosynthesis in mass cultures under bright sunlight conditions. This is implemented upon genetically optimizing the size of the array of chlorophyll molecules that serve as antennae to absorb sunlight for the photosynthetic apparatus. In 2010, the Melis lab pioneered yet a new platform for the renewable generation of isoprene (C5H8) hydrocarbons in cyanobacteria and microalgae, derived entirely from sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), and generated immediately from the primary products of photosynthesis. The process of generating isoprene currently serves as a case study in the development of technologies for the renewable generation of a multitude of biofuels and other useful bio-products. Hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuel and chemicals production via the process of photosynthesis Reprogramming photosynthetic carbon flow in plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria enabled the heterologous generation of fuel and chemicals as clean, renewable and economically viable commodities. However, specific biological problems associated with a sustained, high yield photosynthetic production of these compounds remain to be addressed. Current Objectives: Maximize the solar-to-biomass energy conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria cultivated under high mass-culture or canopy-density conditions. Apply metabolic engineering approaches to enhance carbon partitioning in photosynthetic organisms toward greater terpenoid biosynthesis. Improve the yield of terpene hydrocarbons in plants, microalgae, and cyanobacterial production systems and exploit their photosynthesis for direct \"essential oils\" production. Develop and apply innovative photobioreactor concepts for renewable fuel and chemicals production. Application of the TLA Concept to Enhance the Solar-to-Biomass Energy Conversion Efficiency of Photosynthesis The Melis lab has pioneered in plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria the concept of a Truncated Light-harvesting chlorophyll Antenna size. Such TLA-strains show improved solar-to-biomass energy conversion efficiency of photosynthesis under bright sunlight conditions. The objective of the TLA effort is to approach the theoretical maximum of 8-10% solar-to-biomass energy converion efficiency of photosynthesis, an improvement of up to 300% over the best-case efficiency scenario currrently observed with wild type couterparts. Schematic presentation of incident sunlight absorption and processing by fully pigmented (dark green) microalgae in a high-density culture. Individual cells at the surface of the culture would over-absorb incoming sunlight (more than can be utilized by photosynthesis), and dissipate most of it via non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), thus limiting productivity (P). Note that a high probability of absorption by the first layer of cells would cause shading, i.e., prevent cells deeper in the culture from being exposed to sunlight. Schematic presentation of incident sunlight absorption and processing through cells with a truncated chlorophyll antenna size. Individual cells have a diminished probability of absorbing sunlight, thereby permitting greater penetration and a more uniform distribution of irradiance through the culture. This alleviates NPQ and enhances photosynthetic productivity (P) by the culture as a whole. (From Melis, 2009.) A hydrogen-producing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii culture. Hydrogen bubbles emanate toward the surface of the liquid medium. The gas is drained through a syringe (inserted in the middle of the silicone stopper) and, through Teflon tubing, is collected in an inverted burette and measured by the method of water displacement.

Through its Oleomics™ Project, the Melis Lab seeks to identify and exploit genes, enzymens, and biosynthetic pathways leading to \"essential oils\", including hydrocarbons for fuel and synthetic chemictry feedstock via the photosynthesis of plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria. Schematic of metabolic pathways in Synechocystis transformants, as employed in our work. Photosynthetically assimilated CO 2 yields 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA), which is converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) or pyruvate. Pyruvate and G3P are the primary reactants of the Synechocystis endogenous methylerythritol (MEP) biosynthetic pathway leading to the synthesis of the 5-carbon intermediates isopentenyl-diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Pyruvate decarboxylation leads to acetyl-CoA formation, which is the primary reactant of the heterologous mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway, also leading to the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP. Covalent linkage of IPP and DMAPP yields geranyl-diphosphate, a 10-carbon terpenoid intermediate metabolite, en route toward the generation of longer chain endogenous terpenoids (carotenoids, phytol, and quinone prenyl tails, among other). Heterologous expression of the PHLS gene drains a portion of the GPP pool toward the synthesis of β-phellandrene that spontaneously diffuses out of the cyanobacterial cell. The flow of endogenous carbon substrate toward the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway was enhanced upon heterologous expression of the MVA pathway in Synechocystis , increasing the pool size of IPP and DMAPP substrate. Endogenous and heterologous reactions are delineated in black and red, respectively. (From Formighieri and Melis, 2016.) Custom-designed fed-batch bioreactor for diffusion-based gas exchange and terpene hydrocarbons production. A 100% carbon dioxidegas stream was slowly fed into the gaseous/aqueous two-phase bioreactor via the aerator tube to fill the reactor headspace. Efficient and spontaneous uptake and assimilation of headspace carbon dioxideby the cells occurred by diffusion and was concomitantly exchanged for photosynthetically produced oxygenand terpene hydrocarbons during photoautotrophic growth. Beta-phellandrene hydrocarbons accumulate as floater molecules on the surface of the aqueous phase in the sealed bioreactor. (From Bentley and Melis, 2012.)

       " 'Astar Winoto': 'Astar Winoto Contact Info Williams Endowed Chair and  Professor of Immunology and Pathogenesis Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/winoto/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Our lab is interested in the molecular mechanisms of cell death in the immune system in the context of autoimmunity, cancer and infectious diseases. We are using a combination of biochemical, molecular biological and mouse transgenic/gene targeting approaches in our studies. Current Projects T cell self-tolerance is thought to involve central tolerance (negative selection) involving apoptosis of autoreactive thymocytes and peripheral mechanism through regulatory T cells (Treg). The crucial role of peripheral tolerance has been demonstrated by the lethal autoimmune phenotype of Treg-lessmice. In contrast, evidence supporting an essential role for negative selection has been lacking until recently. Bim, a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein is essential for thymocyte apoptosis. However, its loss doesn’t result in multi-organ autoimmunity. Additional loss of Puma, also a BH3-only protein, can enhance the Bim -/-thymic deletion defects, leading to development of autoimmunity. However, the role of non-T cells in these mice cannot be excluded. Consistent with this, mice with T cell-specific expression of Bcl-2, capable of blocking multiple BH3-only proteins, are largely normal. In addition to Bim, the nuclear receptor Nur77 family members have also been implicated in negative selection. Nur77 family members might function to promote apoptosis by associating with Bcl-2, exposing the Bcl-2 potentially pro-apoptotic BH3 domain. We found that T cell-specific expression of a Bcl-2 BH3 mutant transgene (Bcl-2-BH3*), which can block all these apoptotic pathways, results in enhanced rescue of thymocytes from negative selection when compared to wild-type transgenic Bcl-2. Although Tregcell number is increased, aged Bcl-2-BH3* mutant mice progressively accumulate activated, autoreactive T cells, culminating in development of multi-organ autoimmunity and lethality. Antisera from these mice recognized multiple self-cellular proteins. These data provide strong evidence that negative selection is crucial for establishing T cell tolerance. Current projects are aimed to understand the mechanisms and requirements of these various apoptotic pathways in central tolerance to prevent autoimmunity. Members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) superfamily are involved in diverse biological function, including inflammation, prevention of autoimmunity, cancer, and many others.Indeed, members of this family have become successful targets of drug development for many human diseases. We are interested in the signal transduction events of a subset of the TNFsuperfamily that can initiate cell death. We have shown that FADD is a universal adapter for all TNF receptor-mediated death. Surprisingly, FADD and caspase-8 are also negative regulators of an alternative form of cell death called necroptosis (programmed necrosis). Loss of FADD leads to resistance to apoptosis but FADD-deficient cells undergo necroptosis instead. Current projects are aimed to understand the physiological role of this \"hidden\" cell death pathway in infectious diseases and cancer.

Almost all of these are based on large retailers’ economic leverage over global supply chains. This article documents commonalities in six of the best-studied examples – coffee, dolphin-safe tuna, fisheries, lumber, food processing, and artificial DNA – and offers straightforward economic and political theories to explain them. The theories teach that oligopoly competition can strongly constrain private power so that firms are answerable to a shadow electorate of consumers. Furthermore, rational retailers will find cede significant power to suppliers and NGOs. The arguments generalize traditional claims that free markets constrain private power and suggest an explicit framework for deciding when private politics are legitimate.

This encourages us to see publishers as middlemen who siphon off rents that would be better spent on authors. By comparison, recent social science research emphasizes that word-of-mouth markets are highly imperfect. This means that many deserving titles will never find readers unless some publisher takes the trouble to market them. But this second view is deeply subversive. After all, the need for publishers – and reward – does not end when a book is published. At least in principle, copyright should last forever. The trouble with this argument is that it assumes what ought to be proven. How much effort do publishers really invest in finding forgotten titles? And does vigorous marketing attract more readers than high copyright prices deter? This article looks for answers in the history of 20th Century print publishers and today’s Print-on-Demand and eBook markets. We argue that, far from promoting dissemination, copyright frequently operates to suppress works that would otherwise erode the price of new titles. This pathology has gotten dramatically worse in the Age of eBooks. Meanwhile, public domain publishers are facing their own crisis. Mid-20th Century books had large up-front costs. This deterred copyists. By comparison, digital technologies make it easy for copyists to enter the market. This has suppressed profits to the point where many public domain publishers spend little or nothing on forgotten titles. The article concludes by reviewing possible reforms. Partial solutions include clarifying antitrust law so that firms have more freedom to implement price discrimination; modifying copyright so that consumers can re-sell used eBooks; letting on-line markets limit the number of publishers allowed to post redundant public domain titles on their sites; and strengthening non-commercial institutions for finding, curating, and delivering quality titles to readers.

But this is not the whole story. As the Roman satirist Martial pointed out two thousand years ago, markets routinely ignore good and even excellent works. The insight reminds us that incentives to find content are just as necessary as incentives to make it. Recent social science research explains why markets fail and how timely interventions can save deserving titles from oblivion. This article reviews society’s long struggle to fix the vagaries of search since the invention of literature. We build on this history to suggest policies for the emerging world of online media. Homeric literature was produced and disseminated through direct interactions between audiences and authors. Though appealing in many ways, the process was agonizingly slow. By the 1st Century AD commercial publishers had moved to the modern model of charging readers above-cost prices to pay for search and marketing. Crucially, the new model was only sustainable so long as firms could suppress copying. We argue that Roman and early modern publishers developed remarkably successful self-help strategies to do this. However, their methods did little to suppress copying after the first edition. This seemingly modest defect made publishers profoundly risk averse. Ancient best-seller lists were invariably dominated by authors who had been dead for centuries. Publishers’ self-help systems collapsed under a wave of piracy in the mid-17th Century. This led to the first modern copyright statutes. Crucially, the new laws extended protection beyond the first edition. This encouraged modern business models in which publishers gamble on a dozen titles for each that succeeds. The ensuing proliferation of titles helped fuel the Enlightenment. It also promoted a rich new ecosystem of search institutions including libraries, newspaper critics, and editors. The Digital Age has changed everything. As copyright fades, the old institutions for finding titles are drying up. We explore several possible responses. First, society can shore up current publishing models by expanding copyright and technical protections. We argue that these methods cannot save book search but might be adequate for music and movies. Second, search engines could pay for editors. We argue that an on-line Digital Bookstore can suppress copyists long enough to fund reasonable search efforts. Finally, society can return to the Homeric pattern of harvesting advice directly from audiences. We explore various commercial and open source institutions for organizing the work. (4KB) Public Problems, Private Answers: Reforming Industry Self-Governance Law for the 21stCentury GSPP Working Paper: GSPP14-001 (February 2014) Abstract For the past twenty years, large corporations have routinely developed and enforced industry-wide standards to address problems that are only distantly related to earning a profit. This includes writing detailed private regulations for environmental protection, national security, working conditions, and other topics formerly reserved to governments. At the same time, the US Supreme Court has said that the Sherman Act forbids any “extra-governmental agency” that “provides extra-judicial tribunals for the determination and punishment of violations.” This seems to ban enforceable rules. Despite this, many US policymakers continue to argue that private standards are efficient and desirable. Many corporations are sympathetic but fear legal liability and are reluctant to participate unless and until the law is clarified. This article asks how existing law can be reformed to arrive at principled rules for deciding when private standards violate the Sherman Act. We begin with an historical account of recent private initiatives to regulate food processing, fisheries, forestry, and coffee production. We argue that these private rules are often just as effective – and burdensome – as government regulation. We then generalize from this evidence to explain when and how large corporations are able to impose their preferences through industry-wide standards. We also describe the politics that determines how large corporations use their power. We argue that the need to earn positive profit and defend market share frequently encourages – and sometimes forces – large companies to choose standards that please consumers. In these cases, consumers act as a shadow electorate that constrains private power in much the same way that real voters constrain elected officials. Finally, our examples show that big corporations often decide to share power with smaller rivals, suppliers, NGOs, and other stakeholders. We argue that these delegations are genuine and make private standards more accountable. The article concludes by asking how current law can be reformed. We argue that the Sherman Act serves two goals. The first is economic efficiency. We argue that private standards advance this goal by addressing problems (“externalities”) that lack well-defined market prices. We argue that private bodies should be allowed to address such problems in the first instance knowing that government may later step in to change or supplement policy. The second goal is to protect democracy from private power. We argue that this danger is minimal so long as (a) market structure encourages corporations to make choices that please consumers and other shadow electorates, (b) the standard setting body represents a wide range of affected stakeholders, or (c) industry selects the prevailing standard from multiple competing proposals. Significantly, all of these tests can be determined from objective evidence without obscure metaphysical inquiries into when private power becomes “illegitimate” or “poses a threat” to democratic politics.

GSPP Working Paper: GSPP12-003 (November 2012) Abstract The US Supreme Court’s decision in Graham v. John Deere (1966) placed neoclassical economic insights at the heart of modern patent law. But economic theory has moved on. Since the 1990s, legal scholars have repeatedly mined the discipline to propose ad hoc rules for individual industries like biotech and software. So far, however, they have almost always ignored the literature’s broader lessons for doctrine. This article asks how well today’s patent doctrine follows and occasionally departs from modern economic principles. The article starts by reviewing what innovation economists have learned since the 1970s. While it is conventional for legal scholars to divide the neoclassical literature into multiple competing “theories,” shared mathematical methods and modeling assumptions (e.g. profit-maximization) guarantee that the neoclassical literature’s various strands cannot disagree in any fundamental way. For this reason, whatever differences exist in the neoclassical literature are more accurately seen as special cases of a single underlying theory. We argue that this underlying theory must include at least three principles. The first limits reward to non-obvious inventions and explicitly entered the law through Graham’s PHOSITA standard. The second principle holds that patent breadth should be chosen to balance the benefits of innovation against the costs of monopoly. Though widely recognized by judges and scholars, the principle’s influence on doctrine remains remarkably incoherent. The final principle prescribes rules for allocating patent rewards where multiple inventors contribute to a shared technology. Unlike the first two principles, this insight was unknown in the 1960s and has yet to enter the law. Remarkably, patent doctrine uses a single concept – Graham’s “Person Having Ordinary Skill in the Art” or “PHOSITA” – to address all three principles. This means that doctrinal solutions for one principle can have unintended impacts on the others. In some cases, this link is optional. For example, the article shows how the PHOSITA concept could be generalized to provide separate and distinct tests for, say, non-obviousness and patent breadth. However, other links are mandatory. In particular, the article shows that any doctrinal architecture built on Graham’s PHOSITA test automatically allocates reward among successive inventors. Though reasonable, these default outcomes fall short of the economic ideal. The article analyzes how changes in the Utility, Blocking Patents, Reverse Doctrine of Equivalents, and the Written Description doctrines can mitigate this problem. However, other gaps are inherent and cannot be eliminated without abandoning Graham itself. This radically revised architecture would probably cause more problems than it solves.

Despite this, the US government’s official response has been limited to weak and entirely voluntary Guidelines. This article describes attempts by journal editors, academic scientists, and commercial firms to organize private alternatives at the grassroots level. Private commercial standards, in particular, are significantly stronger than federal Guidelines and currently operate across more than eighty percent of the synthetic DNA industry. The paper generalizes from these examples by asking when strong private standards are both feasible and likely to produce outcomes that are comparably democratic to conventional agency regulation. It closes by describing interventions that government can use to promote and manage grassroots standards initiatives.

This article presents five recent counterexamples. These include initiatives designed to establish new health and safety standards in nanotechnology; build a central repository for worldwide mutations data; use on-line volunteers to find cures for tuberculosis; and require biotech companies to screen customer orders for products that can be used to make weapons. In principle, many more initiatives are both possible and desirable. Historically, however, government done little to promote private initiatives and sometimes destabilized them. The article suggests strategies for this overcoming this problem.

Scholars point out that traditional political initiatives based on regulation and treaty will have difficulty controlling this complex environment. By comparison, market forces routinely impose uniform, worldwide standards (e.g. Windows software, Blu-Ray video players) in many high tech industries. Recently, the companies in one such industry (artificial DNA) used these same economic forces to develop and implement a biosecurity standard. Surprisingly, the resulting standard is more stringent – and at least arguably more enforceable – than the US government’s own official guidelines. This article begins by presenting a short history of how private and public standards evolved in the artificial DNA industry. It then goes beyond this motivating example to ask whether we can expect private non-proliferation standards to be similarly effective in other industries. Next, it reviews what modern theories have to say about standard-setting in both government and the private sector. This analysis suggests that private standards should be reasonably feasible, stringent, and enforceable for many dual use industries. Furthermore, theory suggests that private standards will often reflect society’s risk preferences at least as well as public regulation. The article concludes by suggesting specific reforms for improving private and public standards-setting still further.

We find that the existence of OS business models improves social welfare compared to all-CS industries by letting firms share costs and avoid duplication. However, code sharing also establishes a de facto quality-cartel that suppresses OS firms\\' incentives to invest. Competition from CS firms weakens this cartel and improves welfare. That said, market forces alone provide too little CS competition. We find no support for various government interventions based on tax breaks for OS-based firms and pro-OS procurement preferences by government. However, policies that directly target the supply of OS code have a positive impact. Download a PDF (490KB) The New (Commercial) Open Source: Does it Really Improve SocialWelfare? Co-author: Sebastian Von Engelhardt GSPP Working Paper: GSPP10-001 (January 2010) Abstract The number of open source (“OS”) software projects has grown exponentially for at least a decade. Unlike early open source projects, much of this growth has been funded by commercial firms that expect to earn a profit on their investment. Typically, firms do this by selling bundles that contain both OS software and proprietary goods (e.g. cell phones, applications programs) and services (custom software). We present a general two-stage Cournot model in which arbitrary numbers of competing OS and closed source (“CS”) firms decide how much software to create in Stage 1 and how many bundles to supply in Stage 2. We find that the amount of OS software delivered depends on (a) the degree of substitutability between proprietary products, (b) the number of OS and CS firms competing in the market, and (c) the savings available to OS firms from cost-sharing. However, code-sharing also guarantees that no OS firm can offer better software than any other OS firm. This suppresses quality competition between OS firms and restricts their output much as an agreement to suppress competition on quality would. Competition from CS firms weakens this quality-cartel effect, thus mixed industries often offer higher welfare. We find that Pure-OS (Pure-CS) markets are sometimes stable against CS (OS) entry so that the required OS/CS state never occurs. Even where mixed OS/CS industries do exist, moreover, the proportion of OS firms needed to stabilize the market against entry is almost always much larger than the target ratio required to optimize welfare. We examine various policy options for addressing this imbalance with tax policy, funding of OS development, and procurement preferences. We find that the first-best solution in our model is to tax OS firms and grant tax breaks to CS firms. Conversely, government policies that fund OS development or establish procurement preferences for OS software actually increase the gap between desired and actual OS/CS ratios still further. Despite this, funding OS development can still improve welfare by boosting total (private government) OS investment above the levels that a private cartel would deliver.

We argue that the patent rule is inferior. First, the threat of entry by independent invention would induce patentholders to license the technology, lowering the market price. Provided independent invention is as costly as the original cost of R&D, the market price will still be high enough to cover the patentholder\\'s costs. Second, a defense of independent invention would reduce the wasteful duplication of R&D effort that occurs in patent races. In either case, the threat of independent invention creates a mechanism that limits patentholders\\' profits to levels commensurate with their costs of R&D. Download a PDF (476KB)',\n",

My own studies have focused on the social functions of emotion, arguing that emotions enable individuals to respond adaptively to the problems and opportunities that define human social living. Based on this approach to emotion, I have documented the appeasement functions of embarrassment, the commitment enhancing properties of love and desire, and how awe motivates attachment to leaders and principles that transcend the self. In related studies of emotional disorders, I have documented relations between anger and embarrassment and juvenile delinquency, laughter and anger and problematic outcomes during bereavement and sexual abuse, and deficits in self-conscious emotion and autism and patients with frontal lobe damage. In terms of personality, I have shown that individual differences in positive expressivity, captured from senior yearbook photographs, predict certain personality traits across time, well-being, and marital satisfaction up to 30 years later. We currently are looking at how individual differences in positive emotions, such as awe, compassion, desire, and pride, shape the individual\\'s relationships, physical environment, and sources of pleasure. Power and Social Perception and Behavior Power and status imbue almost every facet of social interaction, from linguistic convention to the economy of emotional expression. I have theorized that elevated power leads to behavioral disinhibition and reduced vigilance. I have found that ideological partisans with power construe their dispute in more stereotypical, polarized fashion, that elevated social status leads to disinhibited social behavior, and that power, whether derived from group status or experimental manipulation, relates to the experience of increased positive emotion and reduced negative emotion. I am also exploring the determinants of power and status. Here we have found that certain personality traits, namely extraversion for women and men, and low neuroticism for men, related to attained status in social groups. We have developed a self-report measure of the experience and use of power, and are exploring how these two factors are distinct, and how they relate to ethnicity, social class, personality, and social outcome. Negotiating Morality My final research interest lies in the study of how humans negotiate moral concerns. Here I have examined how opposing partisans tend to assume that they alone see the issues objectively and in principled fashion, a tendency we call \"naive realism\". We have shown that opposing partisans attribute extremism and bias to their opponents. In studies of moral judgment, I have shown how emotions such as anger, sadness, and fear influence judgments of causality, fairness, and risk. More recently, I have begun to study the contents of three moral domains - autonomy, community, and purity - and how these domains relate to emotion and prejudice. Finally, I have looked more directly at the social practices by which we negotiate norms and morals, relationships, and interpersonal conflict. I have theorized that teasing is one process by which individuals socialize, moralize, negotiate status hierarchies and conflicts, and express potentially embarrassing affections. My studies of teasing have shown how teasing varies according to social status and romantic satisfaction, development, culture, and in children with autism. I have also begun studies of gossip and reputation amongst friends. place Selected Publications Keltner, D., & Haidt, J. (1999). Social functions of emotions at multiple levels of analysis.

       " 'Victoria Kahn': '\\ufeff Victoria Kahn Professor Katharine Bixby Hotchkis Chair in English 4317 Dwinelle Thursdays, 2-4 and by appointment vkahn@berkeley.edu \\ufeff Professional Statement I have been teaching at Berkeley since 1997. Before coming to Berkeley, I taught at Princeton University (1985-96) and UC, Irvine (1996-97). For the English department, I teach courses on Milton, seventeenth-century English literature, and the history of literary theory. For Comparative Literature, I teach courses on the continental Renaissance and literary theory, including The History and Theory of Mimesis, Idols and Ideology, and Tragedy and Trauerspiel. I have a longstanding interest in the history of philosophy and in political theory, and have published widely on Machiavelli and Hobbes. My latest book is The Future of Illusion: Political Theology and Early Modern Texts (Chicago, 2014), which explores the role of early modern texts in the construction of modernity. This work focuses on how twentieth-century thinkers such as Strauss, Schmitt, Cassirer, Kantorowicz, Benjamin, Freud, and Arendt have read and interpreted the work of Machiavelli, Hobbes, Shakespeare, and Spinoza. An edited collection of essays, entitled Politics and the Passions, 1500-1850, appeared from Princeton University Press in 2006. \\ufeff Specialties \\ufeff Renaissance and Early Modern Critical Theory \\ufeff Selected Publications and Papers Delivered T he Future of Illusion: Political Theology and Early Modern Texts , Chicago 2014 Wayward Contracts: The Crisis of Political Obligation in England, 1640-1674 , Princeton, 2004.

My book Wayward Contracts: The Crisis of Political Obligation in England, 1640-1674 (Princeton, 2004) explores the emergence of contract theory in the literature and political thought of mid seventeenth-century England. It argues that contract theory should be seen as part of the linguistic turn of early modern thought, when government was imagined in terms of the poetic power to bring new artifacts into existence. Contract theory should thus be seen not simply as the forerunner of liberalism but as anticipating the eighteenth-century discipline of aesthetics. Other recent work includes an essay on the reception of Machiavelli for The Cambridge Companion to Machiavelli , an essay on Job as a subtext for Milton\\'s Paradise Regained , published in ELH , an essay on Petrarch\\'s Secretum for The Cambridge Compansion to Petrarch, and The Future of Illusion: Political Theory and Early Modern Texts (Chicago, 2014).

Summary Research Selected Publications BS in Plant Science, Cornell University, NY PhD in Biology, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL Summary John Vogel, an adjunct professor in the department, joined the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute in 2014 to establish a plant functional genomics research program. Prior to that he served as a Research Molecular Biologist at the US Department of Agriculture for 12 years where he was a driving force behind the development of numerous genomic resources that fostered the widespread adoption of Brachypodium distachyon as an experimental model for the grasses. Major accomplishments in this context include: Development of a high-efficiency transformation method, leading the international consortium that produced the reference genome sequence The creation of 22,000 sequence-indexed insertional mutants (T-DNA lines), the assembly and characterization of the first large germplasm collection and the resequencing of 54 natural accessions. More recently, his research has expanded to include other Brachypodium species as models for polyploidy and perenniality. In addition to this fundamental work, he established an efficient switchgrass transformation pipeline and, in collaboration with industrial partners, generated hundreds of transgenic switchgrass lines in an effort to create improved varieties for biomass production. He did his postdoctoral studies with Shauna Somerville at the Carnegie Institution for Science where he studied the molecular basis of a plant host’s susceptibility to pathogens Research Brachypodium Resources Vogel’s research is focused on developing plant functional genomic resources and utilizing these resources to understand genome organization and regulation, abiotic stress tolerance and the molecular basis of perenniality. Most projects in his lab utilize B. distachyon and related species as model systems to develop knowledge that will ultimately be used to improve biomass crops like switchgrass. Major projects currently underway include: 1) Using a trio of Brachypodium species as a model for polyploidy in order to understand polyploidy genome evolution and regulation 2) Determining the molecular mechanism of engineered resistance to multiple abiotic stresses and the molecular basis of perenniality using the perennial model grass Brachypodium sylvaticum 3) Developing a comprehensive collection of grass mutants by sequencing chemical and radiation induced mutants.

Research Mariane C. Ferme is a sociocultural anthropologist whose current research focuses on the political imagination, violence and conflict, and access to justice in West Africa, particularly Sierra Leone. Profile I received my PhD in Anthropology from the University of Chicago, after studying Political Science at the University of Milano, Italy, and majoring in anthropology at Wellesley College. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Hellman Family Faculty Fund and France-Berkeley Fund at UC-Berkeley, the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies, and the Carter Woodson Institute for African and African-American Studies at the University of Virginia, among others. I have held teaching appointments at the University of Cambridge, the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Paris, and the Jacques Leclerq Chair at the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. Visiting honorary appointments have included University College, London, and the International Chair at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. My research has long focused on Sierra Leone, and West Africa more generally. It encompasses gendered approaches to everyday practices and materiality in agrarian West African societies, and work on the political imagination in times of violence, particularly in relation to the 1991-2002 civil war in Sierra Leone. I also have done research on the ways in which international humanitarian legal institutions and jurisprudence shape that status in our collective imaginaries of figures of victimhood, criminality, and witnessing in times of war. The empirical focus of this work has been the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and the developing jurisprudence in that setting about the forced conscription of child soldiers and the crime of “forced marriage.” During the 2015-16 academic year, I will carry out a National Science Foundation-supported interdisciplinary research project on changing agrarian institutions and access to land in Sierra Leone. The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea has made the contribution of anthropologists crucial to developing socio-culturally sensitive and acceptable strategies for public health interventions, and to understanding pathways of disease transmission. I have written on the ways in which understanding rural mobility, as well as healing and burial practices, in Sierra Leone and the neighboring countries sheds light on the patterns of EVD infection, and can help inform public health interventions to stem the spread of this disease.

Bratt, Robert J.Wiener GSPP Working Paper (November 2016) Abstract Nonprofit housing development organizations in the U.S. have played a central role in affordable housing provision for decades, but are now encountering a number of challenges, some of which are arising within the organizations, while others stem from changes in the context in which they carry out their work. Our work in this area constitutes the U.S component of a four‐country study of current and anticipated future challenges and opportunities confronting the nonprofit housing sector. Our previous work reported on the findings from a survey modified from one deployed in England, the Netherlands, and Australia. This chapter summarizes our findings from in‐depth interviews that we carried out with leaders from the 12 organizations in our study in two major metropolitan areas of the US: the Boston and San Francisco Regions.

Currently I am studying the systematic interrelationships of Mesozoic mammals, making use of characters of both skeletal morphology and enamel microstructure. A stratigraphically controlled series of early Paleocene (Puercan) local faunas calibrated through 40Ar/39Ar age determinations provides the basis for analyses of the patterns and tempos of terrestrial faunal change during the first million years after the extinctions used to mark the end of the Cretaceous. Graduate student research projects include: Investigation of the phylogenetic interrelationships, locomotor evolution, and turnover rates of Eocene artiodactyls; analysis of phylogenetic interrelationships and biogeographic distributions of Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic members of the Multituberculata; and study of the origins and evolutionary diversification of neornithine birds during the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene.

       " 'Kurt Cuffey': 'Kurt Cuffey Professor and Martin Distinguished Chair in Ocean, Earth and Climate Science Ph.D. University of Washington, 1999 Glaciers, climate, geomorphology 525 McCone Hall 510-642-1641 kcuffey@berkeley.edu The global physical environment is a vast and complex machine composed of numerous interconnected systems capable of dramatic change over brief intervals of time. A solid understanding of the character and dynamics of this machine can explain a diversity of engaging geographical phenomena, from the aesthetically stunning views on a high Sierra Nevada mountain summit to the devastating loss of life and property resulting from landslides and floods. The purpose of my scholarship is to design, improve, evaluate, and enjoy such explanations. Two complementary approaches in this pursuit are (1) to achieve a rigorous physically-based understanding of environmental processes and system dynamics, and (2) to reconstruct the remarkable “natural experiments” of Earth’s environmental history. I use both approaches. Constraints on time, technology, and brainpower have forced me, like most scholars, to the bittersweet reality of specialization; my research efforts emphasize environmental change of polar regions, with a focus on glaciologic problems. The choice of polar glaciology reflects the unique and powerful contributions that this subdiscipline makes to environmental change research. Ice core reconstructions of environmental history offer the most comprehensive, varied, and high-resolution view yet achieved of past environments. The ice sheets themselves are a major control on global sea level and albedo, and on high-latitude atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and on physical landscape characteristics. No other topographic features of this size and importance are changeable on such short time scales. I use a quantitatively rigorous and novel blend of geophysical and geochemical techniques to address questions that are important in this context: How have climatic temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations covaried in the past? What is the tempo and magnitude of climate changes in polar regions? What determines the isotopic composition of precipitation? How have the great ice sheets changed in the past, and how will they change in the future? How do they flow? How are microphysical processes in ice manifest at the scale of whole glaciers and ice sheets? In addition to these major research themes, I also do some work on biogeography and temperate geomorphology. I very much enjoy the breadth and diversity of scholarship in the Berkeley Geography Department (my home department) and also am affiliated with the Department of Earth and Planetary Science and with the Energy and Resources Group.

Eyes of the World. The Grateful Dead, any live version longer than 10 minutes: look it up on YouTube. Live at the Fillmore . Derek and the Dominos (recorded 1970). 4. Some really great passages I found in Proust (Enright/Kilmartin translation): “From decade to decade their wordy battles are renewed, for it is not only social groups that are kaleidoscopic but ideas too about society and politics and religion; refracted through large bodies they can assume a momentary amplitude but their life-span is the brief one of ideas which owe their success to their novelty and gain the adherence only of such minds as are not particular about proof. So it is that parties and schools follow upon one another’s heels, attaching to themselves always the same minds, those men of moderate intelligence who are an easy prey to the successive enthusiasms into which others more scrupulous and less easily satisfied in the matter of proof will decline to plunge.” Time Regained, p. 462 “They thought certainly of these hecatombs of regiments annihilated and passengers swallowed by the waves; but there is a law of inverse proportion which multiplies to such an extent anything that concerns our own welfare and divides by such a formidable figure anything that does not concern it, that the death of unknown millions is felt by us as the most insignificant of sensations, hardly even as disagreeable as a draft.” Time Regained, p. 342 “The town that I saw before me had ceased to be Venice. Its personality, its name, seemed to me to be mendacious fictions which I no longer had the will to impress upon its stones. I saw the palaces reduced to their basic elements, lifeless heaps of marble with nothing to choose between them, and the water as a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, eternal, blind, anterior and exterior to Venice.” The Fugitive, p. 222 ” `It’s the reward of virtue. It’s a marriage from the last chapter of one of Mme Sand’s novels,’ said my mother. (`It’s the wages of vice, a marriage from the end of a Balzac novel,’ thought I.)” The Fugitive, p. 228 “My innocence of the alleged crime was never taken into consideration, for that was the sole hypothesis which nobody was willing to accept for an instant.” The Fugitive, p. 27 “…physical desire has the marvellous faculty of giving intelligence its true value and providing solid foundations for the moral life.” The Fugitive, p. 77 “But in exchange for what our imagination leads us to expect and we give ourselves so much futile trouble trying to find, life gives us something which we were very far from imagining.” The Fugitive, p. 80 “There are moments in life when a sort of beauty is born of the multiplicity of the troubles that assail us, intertwined like Wagnerian leitmotifs, and also from the notion, which then emerges, that events are not situated in the sum of the reflections portrayed in the wretched little mirror which the mind holds in front of it and calls the future, that they are somewhere outside and spring up as suddenly as a person who comes to catch us in the act.” The Fugitive, p. 26-27 “And even if this love leads to disillusionment, it does at least stir, even by so doing, the surface of the soul which would otherwise be in danger of becoming stagnant.” The Captive, p. 661 “And that very morning she had told me [otherwise]! I watched a tongue of flame seize and devour in an instant a novel which I had spent millions of minutes in writing.” The Captive, p. 819 “Was he alluding to the vice which he had succeeded hitherto in concealing from the world, but of which he was himself aware and whose seriousness he perhaps exaggerated, just as children who make love for the first time, or merely before that age seek solitary pleasure, imagine themselves to be like a plant which cannot scatter its pollen without dying immediately afterwards?” Time Regained, p. 418 “… we find a little of everything in our memory; it is a sort of pharmacy, a sort of chemical laboratory, in which our groping hand may come to rest now on a sedative drug, now on a dangerous poison.” The Captive, p. 856 “Then I told her who I was and at once, as though the sound of my name had broken a spell and I had lost the look of an arbutus-tree or a kangaroo which age no doubt had given me, she recognised me …” Time Regained, p. 518 “One was terrified, because it made one think of the vast periods which must have elapsed before such a revolution could be accomplished in the geology of a face, to see what erosions had taken place all the way along the nose, what huge alluvial deposits at the edge of the cheeks surrounded the whole face with their opaque and refractory masses.” Time Regained, p. 510 “The writer’s work is merely a kind of optical instrument which he offers to the reader to enable him to discern what, without this book, he would perhaps never have perceived in himself.” Time Regained, p. 480 Related',\n",

       " 'Hernan Garcia': 'Research Area(s): Biophysics Biography Hernan G. Garcia obtained a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2003. He then moved to Caltech where he obtained a PhD in Physics in 2011 working in the laboratory of Rob Phillips. From 2011 to 2014 he took a postdoctoral position in the Physics Department at Princeton University in the laboratory of Thomas Gregor first as a Dicke Fellow and later as a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award at the Scientific Interface Fellow. Since 2015 he is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology and the Department of Physics at UC Berkeley. Research Interests An abiding mystery in the study of living matter is how a single cell develops into a multicellular organism. As this cell divides, its progeny read the program encoded on their DNA and adopt different fates becoming familiar cell types such as those found in muscle, liver and our brains. We now know that the decisions that cells make during development are not so much based on which genes to express, but rather on when, where and how to express them. Despite advances in determining the identities of the molecules that mediate these decisions we are still incapable of predicting how simple physical parameters such as the number, position and affinity of binding sites for these molecules on the DNA determine developmental fates. We use the fruit fly, one of the classic model systems for embryonic development, together with a combination of new technologies, quantitative experiments, and statistical mechanics in order to provide new insights about cellular decision making during development. In particular, we aim to link the specification of macroscopic body parts in an organism to the non-equilibrium molecular-scale processes inside single cells. The ultimate goal of this interdisciplinary research is to produce a predictive understanding of developmental programs which will enable the rational control of biological size, shape and function.

Before graduate school, he worked in production engineering and control at Merck in Rahway, New Jersey. Professor Kaminsky is the faculty director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology, and director of the Initiative for Research in Biopharmaceutical Operations. He served as department chair of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research in from 2011-2016, and currently serves as Associate Dean for Academic Planning and Development in the College of Engineering. His primary research interests are broadly focused on the analysis and development of robust and efficient tools and techniques for design, operation, and risk management in logistics systems and supply chains. This encompasses operational issues including the modeling and analysis of production and control systems, as well as more tactical and strategic concerns, including the integration of production, distribution, and pricing strategies, and more broadly the analysis of issues that arise in integrated supply chain management. From a methodological perspective, he is particularly interested in the design and analysis of algorithms to address these problems. He also works onissues related to the healthcare system. Much of his current work is centered on two main themes: strategic, tactical, and operational issues that arise in the operation of biopharmaceutical firms; and collaborative, sustainable logistics. In addition, other current projects focus on the development of novel flexible algorithms for supply chain optimization, container terminal operations, efficient operation of operating rooms, and quantitative modeling of behavior change for personalized healthcare. His research is or has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Project Production Institute, BioMarin, Bayer, Genentech, Navis, and FICO.

Ginsborg combines work in the history of philosophy, especially Kant, with an interest in contemporary philosophy, in particular the theory of meaning and the philosophy of mind.  Much of her published work has focused on Kant’s Critique of Judgment , arguing for its importance both to Kant’s own theory of cognitive judgment and to our present-day understanding of cognition.  Recently she has been applying what she takes to be the central insight of the Critique of Judgment to a range of contemporary issues, including rule-following skepticism, the normativity of meaning and content, the content of perceptual experience and the notion of function in biology.   She has also been working on Kant’s theory of experience in the Critique of Pure Reason and on contemporary views about the relation between perceptual experience and belief.  Other interests include aesthetics, especially in connection with music, and the philosophy of biology.  A collection of her articles on Kant’s Critique of Judgment recently appeared as The Normativity of Nature: Essays on Kant’s Critique of Judgement (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015). Ginsborg’s current research project seeks to articulate and develop the notion of “primitive normativity” – a notion drawn from her reading of Kant’s aesthetic theory – and to show how it can be used to address problems about rule-following, knowledge of language and grasp of concepts.',\n",

He has been awarded a Sloan Fellowship (1980), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1989), two Miller Professorships (1986, 1995), the U.S. Department of Energy Award for Sustained Outstanding Research in Solid State Physics (1993), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Outstanding Performance Award (1995), the Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics of the American Physical Society (1996), the Davisson-Germer Prize in Surface Physics of the American Physical Society (1999), and shared with M. L. Cohen the Foresight Institute Richard P. Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology (2003). He is identified by the ISI as one of the most highly cited researchers in physics. Research Interests My interests are in theoretical condensed matter physics and nanoscience including: electronic and structural properties of crystals, surfaces, interfaces and clusters; quasiparticle and optical excitations in solids and nanostructures; electron correlation effects in bulk and reduced-dimensional systems; carbon and BN nanotubes; graphene; superconductivity; electron transport through single molecules and other nanostructures. The objective is to explain and predict the properties of materials using first-principles theories and computation. Current Projects A major interest of my group is nanoscience, in particular, systems involving nanotubes, graphene and molecular junctions. Nanotubes are tubular structures, typically of the order of a nanometer in diameter but microns in length. These quasi-1D materials have novel properties (e.g., chiral currents, quantized conductance, giant excitonic effects, etc.) of fundamental and practical interest. Systems being studied include carbon and BN nanotubes, defects and adsorbates on nanotubes, nanotube junctions, etc. Various structures consisting of assembly of nanotubes and other nano-objects such as fullerenes and clusters are also being investigated. Molecular electronics (i.e., electron transport through single molecules or other nano-objects) and friction (dissipation of mechanical energy) on the nanoscale are also topics of interest. Owing to their reduced dimensionality, highly unusual properties have been predicted and found in the I-V and friction behaviors of nanostructures. Many properties of materials are strongly affected by electron correlation effects. We are developing methods to study these effects. In particular, first-principles interacting one-particle and two-particle Green’s function approaches are used to compute quasiparticle energies and optical spectra for interpreting spectroscopic data and to predict phenomena such as photo-induced transformations. Many-electron effects are particularly dominant in reduced dimensional systems such as surfaces, polymers, graphene, clusters, nanotubes and other nanostructures. We are also interested in superconductivity and phenomena related to electron-phonon interaction and phonon renormalization. Other activities in the group include ab initio studies of novel nano-photovoltaic systems and of the electronic and structural properties of materials under extreme conditions. Publications C. D.

The design of specific chelating agents for metal ions has a wide array of applications and can parallel the approach taken by nature. Professor Raymond's research interests range from biochemistry and metals in medicine to physical inorganic chemistry. The underlying theme of the research projects is the question of metal-ligand specificity of interaction in coordination and bioinorganic chemistry. The specific current research areas are: Supramolecular Chemistry and Catalysis. The Raymond group developed a predictive design strategy resulting in the synthesis of various high-symmetry coordination clusters including M4L6, tetrahedra. By simultaneously fulfilling the symmetry requirements of both the ligand and metal centers, discrete high-symmetry clusters are generated under thermodynamic control. We are exploring the self-assembly of new clusters, thermodynamics and kinetics of cluster formation and host-guest interactions, and chiral resolution in the context of these supramolecular clusters. The M4L6 tetrahedra are able to bind a variety of molecules into their interior cavity. In collaboration with Professors Dean Toste and Robert Bergman, we are investigating chemical reactivity within these hosts. Molecules encapsulated within the host are subject to a unique chemical environment in which reactions take place with enhanced rates or selectivity. The hosts mediate organometallic reactivity, and catalyze organic rearrangements and hydrolyses. Catalysis by M4L6 clusters shares several kinetic features with enzymatic catalysis. And unique product selectivity and 2 million fold rate enhancements have been achieved.. Lanthanide Coordination Chemistry: MRI Contrast Agents. The use of paramagnetic metal complexes as image enhancing agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has opened up a new field of coordination chemistry. Coordination compounds of Gd(III) are currently among the most commonly used MRI enhancement agents. Our group is involved in the synthesis and characterization of hydroxypyridinone and mixed hydroxypyridinone-terephthalamide based complexes that show promise due to their higher relaxivity. This increase in relaxivity is due to both an increase in the number of coordinated water molecules and near-optimal water exchange rates. We have achieved further increases in relaxivity by grafting Gd(III) complexes onto the periphery of large, rigid macromolecules. The current focus is on the preparation of ligand systems whose Gd exchange rates are very slow. Luminescent Lanthanide Agents. The unique spectroscopic properties of the Ln(III) cations are advantageous for imaging or analysis applications based on lanthanide coordination complexes. Each of the elements have characteristic and very narrow emission bands, mostly in the visible and near infrared range. These f-f transitions are Laporte-forbidden, resulting in very long-lived excited states, with typical luminescence lifetimes on the micro- to millisecond timescale. These long lifetimes facilitate 'time-gated' emission experiments which result in drastic improvement in signal to noise ratios compared with more traditional steady-state measurements by removing short lived (eg. protein) emission and scattered excitation. In order to circumvent the low extinction coefficients typical of f-f transitions, the luminescent metal ion can be chelated to a chromophore-containing group which functions as an 'antenna,' absorbing incident light then transferring this excitation to the metal ion, which can then deactivate by undergoing its typical luminescent emission. For example, the efficient sensitization of the strongly luminescent visible emission from Tb(III) and Eu(III) has been achieved using the 2-hydroxyisophthalamide or 1-hydroxypyridin-2-one chelate groups, respectively, in both tetradentate and octadentate ligand topologies. These agents are now in several biomedical assays and their basic photophysical properties remain an active research topic. Actinide Coordination Chemistry. The similarities in the chemical properties and the biological transport and distribution properties of Fe(III) and Pu(IV) explain much of the behavior of plutonium in vivo. In particular, Fe(III) have similar charge to ionic size ratios and hydrolysis properties. These similarities inspired a biomimetic approach to the development of preorganized multidentate sequestering agents for Pu(IV) based on the chelating units found in siderophores, naturally occurring highly selective Fe(III) sequestering agents. The aim of this project is to continue to study the coordination and solution behaviors of ligands for actinide decorporation and selective extraction based on siderophores. This project is the result of a collaborative effort in inorganic chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and actinide biology, and incorporates the design, synthesis, structural and thermodynamic characterization of ligands and their metal complexes with actinides and lanthanides and the evaluation of these compounds in metal ion separations. Increasingly the focus is to reverse this process in the development of targeted alpha particle radiopharmaceuticals.\",\n",

       " 'Peter Duesberg': 'Peter Duesberg Contact Info Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/duesberg/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Research in carcinogenesis Cancer is currently attributed to the mutation of specific genes, which are called oncogenes. This theory does, however, not explain why: (1) All cancers have individual, clonal karyotypes. (2) Oncogenes are not sufficient to transform normal cells to cancer cells. (3) Carcinogens induce cancers only after exceedingly long latencies of many months to decades. (4) Cancers are karyotypically flexible, whereas conventional mutations are stable. (5) All cancers are immortal, despite karyotypic flexibility. In view of the ubiquity of \\'abnormal\\' karyotypes in cancers it is tempting to think that the cancer-specific karyotypic abnormality could be normal. In that case carcinogenesis would be a form of speciation. This speciation theory of carcinogenesis would explain, why cancers have individual karyotypes. It would also explain, why oncogenes are not sufficient to cause cancer. Further it would explain the notorious long latencies from carcinogens to cancer by the very low probalbility of forming a new autonomous karyotype by random karyotypic rearrangements of a precursor - much like in conventional speciation. But would this theory also explain, why cancers are genomically flexible, and why cancers are immortal? Currently we are testing the speciation theory of cancer as an explanation for the unique characteristics of cancer, autonomy, individuality, long latency, clonality and the unique karyotypic flexibilty, as follows: Speciation theory of cancer . Carcinogens, like mutagenic X-rays and non-mutagenic aromatic hydrocarbons, initiate carcinogenesis by inducing random aneuploidy (the loss or gain of chromosomes or segments of chromosomes). Aneuploidy destabilizes the karyotype by unbalancing 1000s of collaborating genes – particularly the balance-sensitive mitosis genes that segregate, synthesize and repair chromosomes. Thus aneuploidy catalyzes chain reactions of random karyotypic variations automatically. These chain reactions have two stable endpoints (see graphic): 1) Cell death from lethal karyotypes, and 2) Rare, new autonomous species with new, individual karyotypes – alias cancer cells. Owing to the inherent instability of aneuploidy cancer karyotypes are flexible within clonal margins. These margins reflect a dynamic equilibrium between destabilization by aneuploidy and selection for autonomy.There is no autonomy outside these margins (see graphic). As a result cancers are clonally heterogeneous. This heterogeneity and the underlying flexibility explain, how cancers \\'progress\\' from bad to worse by evolving ever-new karyotypic subspecies, eg. metastasis and drug-resistance. The steady generation of Immortalizing variants by karyotypic flexibility would also explain, how cancers become avoid Muller\\'s ratchet, ie. the fatal consequences of accumulating lethal mutations. As a result of thier inherent variability cancers are immortal. Benefits of the speciation theory . The theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation predicts improvements in cancer prevention based on elimination of aneuploidogens from food and drugs, and on early detection of preneoplastic and neoplastic aneuploidy for the prevention and treatments of cancer. Research in Virology : Several past reviews of the virus-AIDS hypothesis led to the conclusion that the various AIDS epidemics of the US, Europe and Africa have chemical bases, namely toxic recreational drugs, inevitably toxic DNA-chain terminators prescribed as anti-viral drugs and malnutrition. A recent paper in the Ital J Anat Embryol confirms and extends this view (Duesberg et al., 2011). A precursor of this paper was censored in 2009, a few months after its publication in Medical Hypotheses (Enserink M. (2010) Science vol. 237, p1316). Current Projects Our theory makes several predictions that we are now testing experimentally: (1) Since genesis never repeats itself, our theory predicts that different cancers induced by the same carcinogen have individual karyotypes and phenotypes: \\'One cancer – one karyotype\\'. (2) The theory predicts that new variants of a given cancer, eg. drug-resistance or metastasis, correlate with karyotypic variation, rather than with mutation. (3) The genomic instability of cancers is generated by aneuploidy. If correct the instability is (a) proportional to the degree of aneuploidy and (b) typically affects both the numbers and structures of chromosomes simultaneously, because aneuploidy simultaneously unbalances 1000s of genes.

       " 'Iswar Hariharan': 'Iswar Hariharan Contact Info Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology* *American Cancer Society Research Professor Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/hariharan/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Our laboratory studies the mechanisms that regulate growth at the level of individual cells as well as the entire organism. We are interested in the growth that occurs during development to determine the eventual size and form of an organism. We are also interested in the mechanisms by which damaged tissue is replaced as a result of regenerative growth. To understand the way that growth is regulated in both of these situations, we conduct genetic studies in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster , to identify genes that regulate growth, cell proliferation and cell death. In addition to identifying some of the key regulators of tissue growth in Drosophila, our studies have also helped identify genes that are mutated in human cancers. Current Projects 1) Regulation of growth in imaginal discs during development Over the last ten years, we have conducted a genetic screen that has led to the identification of many genes that restrict tissue growth and cell proliferation in vivo. Following mutagenesis, we generated flies with eyes that contain both wild-type tissue (marked red) and mutant tissue (marked white). By comparing the relative representation of the two types of tissue we can identify mutations that allow mutant cells to outgrow their wild type neighbors. The mutant eye (right image) shows an increase in the relative representation of mutant tissue (white) when compared to the control (left image). Once we identify the mutant flies, we map the mutation and characterize the mutated gene at the molecular level. Further studies of the encoded protein usually provide clues as to how this gene functions to regulate tissue growth. Our eventual aim is to understand the cellular circuitry that regulates the growth process. Genes identified in our screen include the orthologs of the genes mutated in the human disease tuberous sclerosis ( Tsc1 and Tsc2 ), pten , components of the RTK/Ras pathway (e.g. Gap1 , argos, capicua ) as well as many genes that function to regulate growth in ways that are still not well understood. One of the genes that we have characterized archipelago , encodes a protein that facilitates the destruction of Cyclin E and Myc. Another set of three genes ( salvador , warts and hippo ) constitute a novel pathway that restricts tissue growth. For the human orthologs of archipelago and salvador , we identified mutations in cancer cell lines. We and others have identified mutations in the human ortholg of archipelago (hCdc4, FBW7) in primary human tumors. 2) Studies of regeneration in Drosophila The fundamental question in the study of regeneration is why some animals have a remarkable capacity to regenerate damaged tissues while others do not. For instance, while urodele amphibians (salamanders, newts) are capable of regenerating their limbs after amputation, mammalian limbs have very little regenerative capacity. Similarly, in many species, less regenerative capacity is observed in adults than at earlier stages of development. The long term goal of our research is to understand the genetic pathways that regulate the capacity of a tissue for regenerative growth. The imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae are capable of regenerating missing portions when implanted into the abdomen of adult females. However, these experiments are technically difficult and not easily incorporated into large-scale genetic screens. The traditional way of studying imaginal disc regeneration Our system allows the study of imaginal disc regeneration in situ (Drawings by Melanie Worley) To take advantage of the powerful tools of fly genetics, we have devised a way of studying tissue regeneration in Drosophila that does not require surgical manipulations. Using a temperature shift, we are able to ablate the portion of the larval wing imaginal disc that gives rise to the wing blade of the adult, and to study the ensuing regenerative growth. We can easily score the extent of regeneration by examining the size of the wings of adult flies. Our laboratory is currently using this method to study the properties of regenerative growth and to conduct genetic screens for genes that regulate tissue regeneration. We have also addressed the mechanism by which tissue damage in larvae delays pupariation. Our studies indicate that tissue damage activates a developmental checkpoint that delays the production of the peptide hormone PTTH. Since PTTH activates the release of ecdysone by the ring gland and promotes metamorphosis, delaying PTTH production extends the larval stage - a condition that is permissive for regenerative growth. Our results point to a role for retinoids in the mechanism that links tissue damage to delayed PTTH production. This masy provide a tractable model for understanding how individual tissues communicate the presence of damage to the entire organism.

Her research traces the trajectories of literary and expressive cultures from the Caribbean to Britain to the United States and she is most intellectually at home at various intersections: between the diasporic and the queer; imperial identification and colonial resistance; performance and theory; migrancy and domesticity. She teaches classes on postcolonial literature and the city, black diasporic culture, queer theory, and US immigrant literature. Her book, Territories of the Soul: Queered Belonging in the Black Diaspora (Duke, 2015) explores structures of black belonging at the intersection of queer utopianism and diasporic aesthetics of desire, disavowal, and elusiveness. Published and forthcoming essays are on such topics as sexuality and the archive in postwar London, electronic musics and political disaster in Kingston and New Orleans, and performance cultures in contemporary and Emancipation-era Jamaica. She is at work on a new book project about diasporic cities. Her research has been supported by the AAUW, the SSRC, and the Hellman Faculty Fellows Fund, and she has been a fellow at Berkeley\\'s Townsend Center for the Humanities and the Institute for International Studies.

They present a sophisticated, highly complex material consisting mainly of various polysaccharides and polyphenols. The Pauly lab uses a synthetic biology approach whereby all necessary components of the biosynthetic machinery of hemicellulosic and pectinaceous polysaccharides are identified. To achieve this goal we use various genetic approaches including forward, reverse, and chemical genetics with the model organism Arabidopsis, but also maize as a grass species. Research Plant Cell Walls as a renewable resource for Biofuels and other commodity Chemicals With an estimated annual production of 180 billion tons per year plant cell walls (lignocellulosics) present an enormous renewable resource, of which only 2% are utilized by humans. The major bottleneck in utilizing this carbon neutral resource for the sustainable production of second generation biofuels is the recalcitrance of the wall material to degradation. With our various research projects we aim at characterizing the structural features of the wall that lead to this recalcitrance. In the long run such knowledge will aid us in overcoming them. The structure of the Plant Cell Wall Higher plant cells are encased in cell walls that define their shape and contribute to the strength and structural integrity not only of individual cells, but also of the entire plant. Despite its necessary rigidity, the cell wall is a highly dynamic entity that is metabolically active. It plays crucial roles in diverse cell activities such as growth, differentiation, cell-to-cell communication and transport, senescence, abscission, and plant-pathogen interactions. Microcrystalline cellulose is embedded in a hydrated matrix consisting of coextensive networks of complex heteropolysaccharides and sometimes glycoproteins and polyphenols, such as lignin. Our research entails the establishment of an analytical platform for the analysis of wall polysaccharides, a forward genetic approach to identify novel wall structures and reverse genetic approaches to gain insights into wall biosynthesis. Analytical Platform for the Microanalysis of Wall Polysaccharides Our lab uses mainly classical carbohydrate chemistry based methods to describe the structure of particular wall polysaccharides. These methods encompass solubilization of various wall polymers using sequential extraction procedures that make use of wall degrading enzymes and chemicals. The resulting fractions are then analysed using techniques such as monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkage analysis see videos (Lignin analysis: http://www.jove.com/details.php?id=1745 ; Carbohydrate analysis http://www.jove.com/details.php?id=1837) . We also determine the presence of ester substituents (such as O-acetyl-substituents). Since such an analysis is rather labor-intensive and time consuming, an oligosaccharide mass profiling method (OLIMP) using specific polysaccharide hydrolases in combination with mass spectrometry has been developed (Video: http://www.jove.com/details.php?id=2046) . The sensitivity of OLIMP allows for the rapid assessment of even minute amount of tissue-materials. A profile can be obtained from preparations of as little as 500 Arabidopsis cells prepared by a laser-dissection catapulting instrument. Forward Genetic Approach: Identification of Structural Wall Mutants We identify wall mutants by screening of populations of chemically mutagenised seeds for novel structural wall mutants. An Arabidopsis mutants population was screened using OLIMP. It has lead to the identification of 36 distinct mutants with altered xyloglucan structures including the abundance of ester-substituents. Map-based cloning of the mutated genes gave valuable insights into biosynthesis, metabolism and function of structural variations of xyloglucan. For example, it became evident that the microheterogeneity of wall polysaccharides is dependent not on its biosynthetic machinery but on apoplastic \"trimming\" of the sidechains by glycosidases. A maize mutant population was screened for altered sugar content. Indeed, one of the mutants, termed \"candy-leaf 1\" or Cal-1, exhibited a 250% increase in glucan content. Cal-1 is currently tested in the field for enhanced yields of biofuel production. Massive parallel sequencing: Cell Wall Biosynthesis Although information about the structural components of cell walls has increased considerably in recent years, very little is known about the biosynthesis of individual wall components on a molecular level. We employed Ilumina sequencing of plant species that synthesize only a single polysaccharide. This approach lead to the identification of genes in whole biosynthetic pathways. A reverse genetic approach is then employed with the correspondent Arabidopsis genes/mutants to ascertain the function of the gene and its role in polysaccharide biosynthesis. Currently, numerous novel genes involved in the synthesis of nucleotide sugars, the substrates for polysaccharide synthesis, have been identified through bioinformatic means by comparison to gene-sequences of well-characterized bacterial enzymes. In addition, we have identified genes that are responisble for polysaccharide O-acetylation. This substitution is an impediment to enzymatic degradation in a biorefinery and once released presents an inhibitor to many fermenting organisms. The overall goal of these projects is to be able to assemble and reconstruct whole plant polysaccharide pathways in yeast that would produce the particular hemicellulose.

My current research focus is on the comprehensive study of star formation from large magnetized turbulent molecular clouds to the formation of proto-stars and accretion disk using numerical simulations on the latest massively parallel supercomputers. I am using our own Radiative-MHD Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code ORION2 (Li et al. 2012) for all my simulations. With my collaborators Chris McKee and Richard Klein, we are studying theformation and the physical properties of the massive filamentary dark clouds, which are believed to be the precusors of the massive stars and star clusters. The magnetic field properties of the dense clumps and cores inside the dark clouds using large scale AMR simulations are carefully compared with latest Zeeman observations (Li et al. 2015). Extreme high resolution AMR simulations are being conducted to study the importance of radiation and outflow feedback from proto-stars forming inside the filamentary molecular clouds and the formation of disks around the proto-stars.

       " 'Roberto Zoncu': 'Roberto Zoncu Contact Info Assistant Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Lab Homepage: http://www.robertozonculab.org/ Full Directory Information Research Interests How do the nutrients we consume regulate our growth and homeostasis? Answering this question will help us understand not only how we develop, but also how we age and why we become susceptible to diseases as diverse as cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. After decades of research, we know surprisingly little on how nutrients are sensed within cells, and how nutrient-derived signals remodel the cell and enable it to adjust to changing metabolic requirements. Many intracellular compartments, bearing exotic names such as mitochondria, lysosomes and autophagosomes, specialize in storing, releasing and processing metabolites that range from amino acids to sugars, lipids and nucleotides. But how does each organelle sense the quality and quantity of the metabolites it carries? And how is this nutrient and energy information of each organelle communicated to other compartments in the cell? To tackle these questions, we focus on the lysosome as our model system. Using advanced live cell microscopy, in vitro biochemical assays, and high throughput protein and metabolite profiling, we are discovering wonderful new properties of this organelle, which has traditionally been viewed as the cell’s ‘trash can’. Instead, through our work the lysosome is emerging as a key signaling node, which relays nutrient availability to important signaling molecules such as the master growth regulator, mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase (Figure 1). The connection between the lysosome and mTORC1 has important implications for understanding the logic of metabolic regulation. mTORC1 drives biosynthetic processes such as ribosome biogenesis, mRNA translation and lipid synthesis. In turn, the lysosome mediates the breakdown of superfluous or damaged cellular components, thus providing a source of fuel and quality control for the cell. Our findings suggest that localized mTORC1 activation at the lysosome may provide a means for the cell to integrate biosynthetic and catabolic processes in space and time. Moreover, elucidating the connection between mTORC1 and the lysosome may point the way to novel approaches for pathologies in which mass accumulation and cellular quality control are deranged, primarily in cancer and protein misfolding diseases. Current Projects My postdoctoral work contributed to illuminating the mechanism through which amino acids activate mTORC1. We found that amino acids promote the translocation of mTORC1 from the cytoplasm to the lysosomal surface, where mTORC1 binds to a scaffolding complex composed of the Rag GTPases and Ragulator (Figure 2). Moreover, I found that amino acid signals from within the lysosomal lumen play an especially important role in mTORC1 activation. The proton pump, vacuolar H + ATPase (V-ATPase), relays this ‘inside-out’ amino acid signal by binding to and regulating the Rag GTPases and Ragulator [Zoncu R. et al , Science (2011)]. Building on these findings, we will investigate the lysosome as a metabolic ‘command and control’ center that i) functions as a signaling hub for nutrient sensing and signaling and ii) controls the storage and delivery of key substrates to the cell’s metabolic pathways. Exploring these exciting directions poses significant challenges. We do not yet have a comprehensive list of the lysosomal resident proteins and internal metabolites. Moreover, we do not understand how the lysosome’s many parts work together to regulate biophysical properties of this organelle such as its internal acidity and membrane potential. We will meet these challenges by developing novel techniques to probe organelle function both in vivo and in vitro, and by integrating them with advanced live cell microscopy and high throughput approaches. What are the mechanisms of nutrient sensing at the lysosome? The ‘inside-out’ model of amino acid sensing poses intriguing questions: do amino acids bind to and modulate the V-ATPase from within the lysosomal lumen? How does the V-ATPase regulate the function of the mTORC1 scaffolding complex composed of Ragulator and Rag GTPases? Is the ATP hydrolysis rate and ADP/ATP ratio important? How does the proton gradient across the lysosomal membrane participate in amino acid sensing? We will address these questions using in vitro biochemical assays of mTORC1 binding and V-ATPase activity, in combination with live cell imaging experiments. Through collaborative work, we will gain structural insight into the overall assembly and regulation of this nutrient-sensing complex. These studies will shed light on how the lysosome senses its internal status and relays this information to downstream signaling effectors to regulate growth and metabolism. How does the lysosome transport and store nutrients? Our finding that the lysosome participates in amino acid sensing implies that this organelle must be able to dynamically exchange nutrients with other cellular compartments. To gain insight into how this is accomplished, we are developing techniques for the rapid and efficient capture of lysosomes from whole cells (Figure 3). Using time-resolved metabolite profiling of highly purified lysosomal preparations, we have obtained preliminary evidence that amino acids and other metabolites cross the lysosomal membrane bi-directionally in response to the nutritional status of the cell. However, we do not know the molecular identity of the transport systems of the lysosomal membrane, and how these transporters function together to regulate mTORC1 activity and cellular growth. Thus, we will combine proteomics-aided identification of candidate transporters with functional assays and in vitro reconstitution to shed light on the nutrient transport network of the lysosome. Finally, we will investigate how, in a class of diseases known as lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), disruption of nutrient transport may contribute to metabolic derangement and cell death. What regulates lysosomal composition and function? Our work on amino acid sensing places the lysosome upstream of mTORC1. We recently found that, in turn, mTORC1 exerts a powerful regulatory action on lysosomal function and catabolism. Amino acids, acting via mTORC1, tightly control the activity of TFEB, a transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy [Settembre C., Zoncu R. et al , EMBOJ (2012)] (Figure 4). This lysosome-to-nucleus signaling mechanism, which connects the lysosome’s internal status to catabolic gene expression programs, may be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of a vast regulatory network for metabolic adaptation. To further explore this network, we will investigate how candidate mTORC1 and TFEB effectors, which we recently identified, control key properties of lysosomes, including their formation, trafficking and their ability to communicate and exchange nutrients with other important organelles. In summary, our ultimate goals are to elucidate how organelles mediate nutrient sensing and utilization, and to illuminate the functional architecture of cellular metabolism in space and time.

This paper provides new causal estimates of the effects of racial residential segregation during childhood on subsequent adult attainment outcomes. I account for the potential endogeneity of segregation and neighborhood location choice using instrumental variables based on 19th Century railroad track configurations, historical migration patterns, political factors, and topographical features. Following Ananat (2011), it is shown that cities that were subdivided by railroads into a greater number of physically-defined neighborhoods became significantly more segregated after the Great Migration of African-Americans to northern and western cities. To examine the consequences of segregation during childhood, this study analyzes the life trajectories of children born since 1950 and followed through 2009. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) spanning four decades are linked with information on neighborhood attributes and school quality resources that prevailed at the time these children were growing up. Results from 2SLS/IV models demonstrate that, for blacks, the level of racial residential segregation during childhood negatively impacts subsequent educational attainment, reduces the likelihood of high school graduation, increases the probability of incarceration, reduces adult earnings and the likelihood of intergenerational mobility, increases the annual incidence of poverty in adulthood, and leads to worse health status in adulthood; segregation effects for whites were not statistically significant across each of these outcomes but the point estimates were in the opposite direction of the corresponding estimates for blacks. The results are consistent with prior research that has found that increased segregation leads to more inequality in spending across districts of the same MSA, thus worsening the relative position of poorer districts.

For example, it has been shown that 42 percent of men raised in the bottom quintile of incomes remain there as adults, while only 8 percent of US men at the bottom rise to the top quintile (Jantti et al., 2007). While public policies that promote equalization of educational opportunity have been emphasized as keys to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, there exists limited causal evidence of the mechanisms that underlie intergenerational immobility. Few studies have attempted to isolate the causal effect of education on the next generation’s well-being. This is in part due to formidable empirical challenges that arise from the paucity of large nationallyrepresentative data sets with information both on parental and child outcomes over the life cycle,and the difficult search for a credible identification strategy. This paper uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics spanning 4 decades (PSID: 1968-2009) to link three generations of adult outcomes. The analyses exploit the historical period and quasirandom timing of court-ordered school desegregation to quantify the extent to which children’swell-being can be improved by increased parental education and document the intergenerational returns to education. The first stage of the analysis (using the “parent sample” that consists of cohorts born between 1950-1970) builds on prior findings that demonstrate for blacks, school desegregation significantly increased educational attainment, with no significant desegregation effects on whites’ educational outcomes (Johnson, 2011). The present study provides new evidence on the causal influence of parental education across generations by using the timing of initial court orders and resultant differences in childhood exposure to school desegregation as an instrument for parental education, linked (in the second stage) with their children’s subsequent life outcomes (using the “child sample” that consists of cohorts born since 1980). The 2SLS/IV framework and intergenerational research design utilized enables this work to assess the impact of school desegregation on children and their families into the third generation. I find a considerable impact of school desegregation that persists to influence the outcomes of the next generation, including increased math and reading test scores, reduced likelihood of grade repetition, increased likelihood of high school graduation and college attendance, improvements in college quality/selectivity, and increased racial diversity of student body at their selected college. The findings demonstrate that part of the intergenerational transmission of inequality can be attributable to school quality related influences. The results in turn highlight parental education as a causal determinant of generational mobility.

In addition to the extensive literature on the impacts of Head Start on test scores, the present studybuilds on and contributes to a burgeoning literature investigating long-term impacts of early life interventions (childhood programs in the first decade of life). The paper’s results complement the findings of studies on the long-term impacts of other early childhood interventions, such as the Perry and Abecederian preschool demonstrations, Nurse-Family Partnership, and kindergarten class size in the Tennessee STAR experiment (Chetty et al., 2010), which also find lasting impacts on adult outcomes despite fade-out on test scores.

Inparticular, I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its Child Development Supplement (PSIDCDS) matched to children’s school and neighborhood characteristics and school desegregation policyvariables. Using an event study framework and difference-in-difference model, I examine the impacts of the termination of mandated desegregation plans on academic achievement outcomes, including cognitive test scores, high school graduation rates, educational attainment, and non-cognitive behavioral outcomes, separately by race. Preliminary results show that the increased allocation of school resources to those in high poverty, minority neighborhoods following the release of continued court oversight actually served to mitigate the potential negative impacts of resegregation on black student achievement (at least in the short-run).

Recent research indicates that credit constraints have played a larger role in college enrollment and completion rates over the past 15-20 years (Lochner and Monge-Naranjo, 2011; Lovenheim, 2011). Prior evidence found greater credit constraints in the US than Canada (Belley et al., 2009). Housing wealth has become an increasingly important component of the college enrollment decision over the past 15 years (Bound et al., 2010). The parental wealth depletion following the Great Recession and housing market collapse has potentially important implications for college prospects of our youth. A recent survey of young adults found that 20% aged 18-29 have left or delayed college (Greenberg and Keating 2009). A survey conducted in Colorado found that 1/4 of parents with children in 2-year colleges planned on sending their kids to 4-year institutions before the recession (CollegeInvest 2009). This study provides new evidence on the impact of parental wealth on educational attainment. In order to address the endogeneity of parental wealth, the empirical strategy analyzes parental housing wealth changes induced by local housing booms of the late 1990s and early 2000s, and the subsequent housing bust of the 2007-2009 period. Using geocoded data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968-2009) linked to MSA housing price data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, I examine how changes in parental housing equity in the four years prior to their child being college-age affect the likelihood that the child attends college and where they attend (2-year vs. 4-year; in-state vs out-of-state; college quality). This provides a test of the role of parental wealth (and potential credit constraints) in influencing post-secondary decisions, including if, when, and where individuals attend and complete college.

The Role of Schools as a Vehicle to IntergenerationalMobility GSPP Working Paper (March 2010) Abstract Access to quality schools and educational resources for children are key engines of upward mobility in the US, holding the potential to break the cycle of poverty from one generation to the next. Residential segregation by race and class that leads to unequal access to quality schools is often cited as a culprit in perpetuating inequality in attainment outcomes. However, the role of child neighborhood and school quality factors in contributing to the intergenerational persistence of economic status, and as sources of racial differences in rates of intergenerational mobility, have received little attention in the literature. This paper analyzes the effects of the court-ordered desegregation plans of public schools, implemented in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, on the extent of intergenerational mobility. I exploit the wide variation in the timing of implementation of desegregation plans to identify their effects. The empirical analysis makes two unique contributions by investigating: (1) the effects of court-ordered desegregation plans of public schools on adult socioeconomic attainment outcomes and attempts to separately identify the effects of neighborhood and school quality; and (2) the role of childhood school and neighborhood quality in contributing to racial differences in intergenerational mobility.

The analysis utilizes the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, spanning 1968-2005, and follows a cohort born between 1951 and 1970 from childhood into adulthood. I examine the extent of upward and downward residential mobility/instability from childhood through mid-adulthood using PSID geocoded neighborhood information and residential location patterns over 35 years. Characterizing the length of exposure to poor neighborhood conditions for different demographic groups also serves to shed light on the age-profile of neighborhood effects on later-life attainments, including adult health and economic status. The results highlight substantial race differences in the incidence and duration of exposure to concentrated poverty over the life course. The study reveals high rates of immobility from poor neighborhoods over the life course, especially among AfricanAmericans. The results demonstrate that the average black child spent ¼ of childhoodyears in high poverty neighborhoods, one-third of early-to-mid adulthood years in high poverty neighborhoods, and fifteen percent of adulthood years lived in low poverty neighborhoods. This is in stark contrast to those rates for the average white child, who spent just three percent of childhood and adulthood years in high poverty neighborhoods, spent eighty percent of childhood years in low poverty neighborhoods, and more than half of early-to-mid adulthood years in low poverty neighborhoods. The analysis shows that black-white differences in adulthood exposure to neighborhood poverty are largely accounted for by differences in the likelihood of being born into a poor neighborhood, and to a lesser extent by differences in rates of upward and downward socioeconomic mobility over the life course.

Most of the black-white difference in life expectancy stem from racial differences in mortality rates prior to age 65. Thus, understanding sources of racial health disparities requires the investigation of exposures to socioeconomic conditions and risk factors earlier in the life cycle. Blacks’ higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease-related risk factors account for more than half of the racial disparity in life expectancy (Barghaus, Cutler, Fryer, and Glaeser, 2007), with hypertension the leading culprit. For a US cohort born between 1951 and 1970, I produce nationally representative estimates of the onset of hypertension through mid-life by race/ethnicity, childhood socioeconomic status, and childhood neighborhood poverty. I provide evidence on the consequences of childhood neighborhood poverty on the risks of hypertension; this is the first such study of the full US population. I use nationally representative longitudinal data from the US spanning nearly four decades to estimate hazard models of onset of hypertension. The data set, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), has the additional unique feature of allowing analyses of siblings and child neighbors throughout much of their life course. I use the resemblance between neighboring children’s subsequent likelihood of hypertension in adulthood in comparison to the similarity between siblings to bound the proportion of inequality in this health condition that can be attributed to disparities in neighborhood and family background. I estimate four-level hierarchical random effects hazard models of the onset of hypertension, which provide a better understanding of the relative importance of family and neighborhood backgrounds. The results demonstrate that both childhood neighborhood conditions and family background influence the disease process and risk of hypertension later in life. I find childhood neighborhood poverty and its attendant stressors play an influential role in shaping risks of onset of hypertension in middle-age. Other notable neighborhood factors that were shown to influence risks of onset of hypertension in adulthood include childhood neighborhood crime exposure and county per-pupil school expenditures. Notable family background factors include birth weight, parental health status, and parental socioeconomic status. These effects appear linked in part to low intergenerational economic mobility, particularly among blacks. The results indicate that racial differences in these early life neighborhood conditions and family background characteristics play a significant role in explaining racial disparities in hypertension through at least age 50, while contemporaneous economic factors account for relatively little of the racial disparities in this health condition in adulthood.

I show that men born in the 1960s/early 1970s have significantly greater cumulative lifetime risks of imprisonment than similarly-aged men born in the 1950s. This is in part a direct consequence of the transformation of incarceration and sentencing policy that took off in the 1980s. The racial disparities in lifetime incarceration risks are alarming. The results highlight that among black low-educated men, one-half either died or had been incarceration before the age of 40. Second, this analysis uses an innovative approach to investigate the relative importance of family background and neighborhood context on deviant behavior over the life course, including ever being expelled, criminal involvement, ever being incarcerated, the early formation of risk preferences, and risky health behaviors. Particularly noteworthy, the analysis of brother and male child neighbor correlations in adult incarceration history revealed remarkably high correlations of 0.69 and 0.54, respectively. These results highlight the profound influence that family and/or neighborhood background has on criminal involvement and risks of imprisonment. Moreover, the results suggest that neighborhood quality during childhood is a significant gatekeeper of the intergenerational transmission of deviant behavior and incarceration risks among males. Third, this study examines the intergenerational consequences by examining children of the next generation. I find, using the PSID-CDS data, that the prevalence rates of parental incarceration at some point during childhood are significantly larger than point-in-time estimates. I find that 20 percent of black children had a father with an incarceration history; and among black children with fathers who did not graduate from high school, an alarming 33 percent of their father’s had an incarceration history. Fourth, this study is among the first longitudinal child-outcome studies that examines the role of pre-incarceration risk factors and children’s living arrangements, parent-child relationships and substitute caregiver-child relationships, to help determine the impact of parental incarceration on families and children. I find linkages between exposure to parental incarceration and child behavioral outcomes. The pattern of results is remarkably similar across all of the empirical approaches utilized that address omitted variables bias—including hierarchical random effects models with an unusually extensive set of controls, family fixed effect models, child fixed effect models, and instrumental variables estimates. This study bears evidence on the extent to which parental incarceration has exacerbated racial disparities in childhood and in early adulthood.

       " 'Neil Fligstein': 'Professor Research Interests: Economic sociology, organizations, methodology and statistics, political sociology Office: 452 Barrows Phone: 510-643-1957 Curriculum Vitae: fligvita2015.pdf Profile: Neil Fligstein is the Class of 1939 Chancellor\\'s Professor. He is also the Director of the Center for Culture, Organization, and Politics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. His main research interests lie in the fields of economic sociology, organizational theory, and political sociology. He has been interested in developing and using a sociological view of how new social institutions emerge, remain stable, and are transformed to study a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena including the history of the large American corporation and the construction of a European legal and political system. He has used this framework to create a more general view of how markets and states are mutually constitutive and applied this framework to trying to make sense of how global markets work. In 2008, he published a book entitled Euroclash: The EU, European Identity, and the future of Europe (Oxford, Eng.: Oxford University Press, 2008). The central theme of the book is to document how European integration in the past 20 years has created a partial integration of European societies along political, economic, but most importantly social lines. Europe has mostly brought managers, professionals, and other highly educated people into contact. It is this 13% or so of the population that is most European. But the remaining population is mostly wedded to conceptions of self that are distinctly national. This explains how the European project is limited. Without a massive change in the way that most people view themselves, it is difficult to see how more political integration will occur. With Alina Polyakova and Wayne Sandholtz, he has continued to explore the theme of identity and how it is related to the rise of natuionalist parties in Europe, particularly in the wake of the financial crisis. His book with Doug McAdam, titled of A Theory of F ields (Oxford University Press,2012), is a theoretical work that tries to combine insights from institutional theory, social movements theory, and organizational theory to create a general set of understandings of how new social spaces are constructed, maintained, and transformed. At the core of the book, is a distinctly sociological view of social action, one that is based on symbolic interactionism. Professors Fligstein and McAdam think that such a theory can prove very useful to understand strategic action by individuals and groups across a wide variety of social settings, including the organization of markets, politics of all kinds, and social movements. Professor Fligstein has written a series of papers with Adam Goldstein, Jacob Habinek, Jonah Stuart Brundage, Michael Schultz, Alex Roehrkasse and Zawadi Rucks Ahidiana about the financial crisis that has swept the industrialized world since 2007. The papers with Adam Goldstein consider the history of the mortgage securitization industry and its development in tandem with government policy. One of the papers also chronicles how investment, commercial, and savings and loans banks converged on a vertically integrated model of producing mortgages and securities and it was their lockstep move into the subprime market that ultimately set off the collapse. The work with Jacob Habinek considers how the crisis spread to other countries. Using a quantitative data set, they show that the main cause of the crisis was the purchase of American mortgage backed securities by banks in the developed world. The work with Jonah Stuart Brundage and Michael Schutz takes up the question of why the regulators, in this case the Federal Reserve, failed to understand the crisis as it was approaching. Using topic modelling and more traditional text analysis, we show that the macro-economics framing of the economy made it difficult for the Federal reserve\\'s Open Market Committee to see the connections between the house price bubble and the crisis of the banks. The paper with Alex Roherkasse explores why most of the banks committed crimes, either predatory lending or seccurities fraud. Finally, the paper with Zawadi Rucks Ahidiana shows that the wealthiest 10% of households in the U.S. actually saw their wealth increase relative to everyone else during the housing crisis of 2007-2009. This is because many of the households who bought homes in the last years of the real estate bubble either lost their homes or found themselves under water financially. The wealthiest 10% saw their wealth levels begin to recover as the stock market and housing prices in some areas came back in 2009. Professor Fligstein is currently working on a book that broadly considers the rise and fall of the mortgage securitization industry from a broad historical perspective. The book is tentatively titled The Banks Did It . In a related project, Professor Fligstein has begun to explore the role of consumers in the more general process of financialization. Scholars have argued that consumers have had to become more financially savvy since the 1980s as they have taken control of their pensions, used their houses as investments, and managed large amounts of debt. The purpose of this project is to explore the degree to which this was true and to understand who and under what conditions various households began to act more and more like financial economists. In a paper with Adam Goldstein, they have shown that while everyone in America has more relaxed attitudes towards taking on debt to support their lifestyles, risk taking is restricted to the top 20% of the population. They show that the main source of new indebtedness is housing. New work, with Orestes Hastings and Adam Goldstein extends this by using longitudinal data to show that households tried to keep up with those who were near or above them in the income distribution by buying better housing even if it meant taking on more debt as house prices increased from 1999-2007.

Chapters consider: 1.) Enlightenment philosophical anthropology (Buffon, Rousseau, Ferguson, Herder, Kant); 2.) The new Romantic genres of the Bildungsroman and the historical novel (Goethe, Staël, Scott) ; 3.) Lamarckian / Geoffroyan historical romances circa 1830 by Scott ( Count Robert of Paris ) and Hugo ( Notre-Dame de Paris ); 4.) Dickens\\'s Romantic transformism in Bleak House (cf. Owen, Chambers) versus the anthropomorphic techniques of Victorian realism; 5.) \"Species consciousness\" and the science-fiction turn in George Eliot\\'s major novels. My other current work in progress is a book called Scotland and Romanticism , for Cambridge University Press. It willl offer a short, authoritative critical overview of Scotland\\'s long Romantic century, from the late eighteenth-century projects of the human sciences and revivals of indigenous poetry to Scott\\'s late novels and Carlyle\\'s French Revolution . Part I explores the genres and institutions of Scottish Enlightenment and Romantic-period writing; Part II examines a series of case studies according to representative topoi: the lost nation, popular festivity, world literature, and the fanatic. I am also thinking about a short book on Charles Darwin and the relations between scientific and aesthetic conceptions of form in nineteenth-century writing; and maybe another short book, on Scott\\'s late career (1825-32). \\ufeff Recent English Courses Taught Spring, 2017 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 45B/1 Literature in English:  Mid-17th to Late-19th Century Introductory Surveys 45B/101 -- discussion section No instructor assigned yet. 45B/102 -- discussion section No instructor assigned yet. 45B/103 -- discussion section No instructor assigned yet. 45B/104 -- discussion section No instructor assigned yet. 246H/1 Graduate Pro-seminar:  Victorian Period Graduate Courses Fall, 2016 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 170/2 Literature and the Arts:  Opera and Literary Form World Literature Drama Special Topics Spring, 2016 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 45B/1 Literature in English:  Late-17th through Mid-19th Centuries Introductory Surveys 45B/101 -- discussion section de Stefano, Jason 45B/102 -- discussion section Wise, Diana Catherine 45B/103 -- discussion section Sirianni, Lucy 203/1 Graduate Readings:  George Eliot and Victorian Science British 19th-Century Novel Graduate Courses Spring, 2015 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 166/1 Special Topics:  Scotland and Romanticism Pre-1800 Requirement British 18th-Century British 19th-Century World Literature Novel Poetry Special Topics Show ALL Courses Back',\n",

CAREER David Collier\\'s research focuses on political methodology, including concept analysis, qualitative methods, and strategies of multi-method investigation. His current work is concerned with the challenges of integrating case-study and medium-N analysis. Throughout his career, Collier has also studied democracy and authoritarianism, regime transitions, labor politics, party system dynamics, and class coalitions -- focusing primarily on Latin America. The major book he coauthored with Ruth Berins Collier, Shaping the Political Arena (1991, 2002), was one of the first extended, historical analyses of critical junctures and path dependence to be published in political science. Corresponding to these substantive interests, Collier\\'s work on concept analysis includes numerous examples from the literature on democracy, authoritarianism, and regime change. At Berkeley, Collier has been Chair of the Political Science Department and of the Center for Latin American Studies, and he was founding Co-Director of the Berkeley-Stanford Program in Latin American Studies. He has served as President of the Comparative Politics Section of the American Political Science Association, has been a Vice President of APSA, and was the Founding President of the APSA Organized Section for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research. He has played an active role in building the Institute for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research, an international training program held annually at Syracuse University. Collier is centrally involved in training scholars in the fields of Latin American politics, comparative politics, and methodology. He won Berkeley’s campus-wide Distinguished Faculty Mentor Award, as well as the Powell Graduate Student Mentoring Award of the APSA Comparative Politics Section. Collier has been a Guggenheim Fellow and a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He is an elected Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was awarded the 2014 Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science.

Her first book, Economists and Societies (Princeton University Press 2009), explored the distinctive character of the discipline and profession of economics in three countries. A second book, The Ordinal Society (with Kieran Healy ), is under contract. This book investigates new forms of social stratification and morality in the digital economy. Other recent research focuses on the valuation of nature in comparative perspective; the moral regulation of states; the comparative study ofpolitical organization (with Evan Schofer and Brian Lande ); the microsociology of courtroom exchanges (with Roi Livne ); the sociology of economics, with Etienne Ollion and Yann Algan , and with Rakesh Khurana ; the politics of wine classifications in France and the United States (with Rebecca Elliott and Olivier Jacquet ). A final book-length project, Measure for Measure: Social Ontologies of Classification , will examine the cultural and institutional logic of what we may call \"national classificatory styles\" across a range of empirical domains. Fourcade is also an Associate Fellow of the Max Planck-Sciences Po Center on Coping with Instability in Market Societies (Maxpo) , and a past President of the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics (2016).

       " 'David Raulet': 'David Raulet Contact Info Esther and Wendy Schekman Chair in Basic Cancer Biology, and Professor of Immunology and Pathogenesis Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs2/raulet/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Lymphocytes employ various recognition strategies to attack viruses, microorganisms and cancer cells. Our primary interest is in understanding how natural killer (NK) cells and T cells recognize and destroy cancer cells and infected cells, how their recognition apparatus is coordinated with differentiation of immune cells, and how this information can be used for therapy or prevention of disease. Current Projects Natural killer cells, NKG2D and NK self tolerance. Natural killer (NK) cells play roles in immunity to viruses, parasites, and cancer cells. Individual NK cells express receptors that stimulate the cells and distinct receptors that inhibit them. We have a general aim to investigate the specificity and function of NK cell receptors, and have provided key data on many of them. NKG2D is a key activating receptor expressed by NK cells and some T cells that we are currently investigating in detail. It recognizes any of several host-encoded cell surface ligands (collectively called NKG2D ligands). NKG2D ligands are upregulated in cancer cells and cells infected with certain viruses. Engagement of a ligand on an unhealthy cell causes the NK cell to kill it and secrete cytokines. We generated knockout mice lacking the receptor and demonstrated a defect in tumor immunosurveillance, providing evidence for innate surveillance of cancer. A current emphasis in the lab is to define pathways that activate ligand expression in cancer cells and virus-infected cells. We have demonstrated the role of (a) proliferation-associated signals, specifically the E2F transcription factors, which regulate cell cycle entry but also the activate transcription of a set of NKG2D ligands in certain proliferating cell types; (b) the DNA damage response, a protein kinase cascade induced in transformed cells and certain infected cells; (c) cells exposed to heat shock; (d) the PI-3 kinase pathway (in collaboration with the Coscoy lab), activated in virus-infected cells and cancer cells. We have also found that another signal associated with cancer, specifically activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, promotes the recruitment of NK cells into tumors. The roles of additional pathways are under investigation. The broad aim is to dissect how these signals work together to regulate the sensitivity of unhealthy cells, and to exploit this knowledge for enhancing immunotherapy. In addition, dysregulation of this system can promote inflammatory diseases, so blockade of NKG2D has potential for therapy of such diseases. Most inhibitory receptors expressed by NK cells recognize class I MHC molecules and function to prevent the lysis of cells that express class I molecules normally, and allow the destruction of those that do not. Although NK cells are considered components of the innate immune response, we discovered that they have the potential to attack self cells, and this potential must be limited by mechanisms that render NK cells self-tolerant. The self-tolerance mechanism represents a tuning mechanism that sets the triggering threshold of individual NK cells so as to maximize reactivity against unhealthy cells while preventing reactivity against self. The cellular signaling processes that underlie self tolerance of NK cells is under investigation. T cell development and function. α/β T cells and γ/δ T cells differentiate in the thymus. In the γ/δ cell lineage, we showed that instead of a largely random gene rearrangement process, as occurs in the α/β lineage, a directed V gene rearrangement process occurs, which helps to generate waves of distinct thymic progenitor cells with different specificities independent of cellular selection, and distinct function in the immune response. Emerging evidence indicates that different subtypes of γ/δ T cells play distinct roles in allergy, autoimmunity and host defense. We have a number of excellent tools for analyzing γ/δ T cells and we plan to investigate the specialized roles of these cells in the immune response. We are also interested in the developmental mechanisms that generate these different sets of T cells. With the use of transgenic and gene-targeted mice, we showed that V gene promoter sequences and the location of the gene determine the order in which it is rearranged in development. The system is ideal for unraveling important features of the molecular regulation of V-D-J recombination during development. We further discovered an intrathymic selection process for γ/δ T cells that operates in the fetal stage, and induces a gene program that enables fetal γ/δ T cells to migrate to intraepithelial locations.

In 2009 he started the Fungal Genomics program at the Institute to scale up sequencing and analysis of diverse fungi related to DOE science and applications, which led to large projects like \"1000 Fungal Genomes\" or \"Fungal miini-ENCODE\". He also led annotation of a large collection of algal genomes ( genome.jgi.doe.gov/Algae ). Prof. Grigoriev organized more than 50 genomics workshops and engaged several thousands researchers around the world in genome projects, which resulted in over 100 high-profile publications. There are more than 1.5 million fungal species and they play a critical role in shaping the Earth\\'s ecosystems. Better understanding of pathogens and symbionts is critical for a sustainable growth of plants. Fungi are the most efficient degraders of plant biomass to convert it into bioenergy and bioproducts. Many new metabolic processes and enzymes are encoded in fungal genomes. Fungal genomics may offer answers to critical areas of research, including food, medicine, energy and the environment.

       " 'John Ngai': 'John Ngai Contact Info Professor of Neurobiology* *Coates Family Professor of Neuroscience, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute; Director, QB3 Functional Genomics Laboratory Lab Homepage: https://sites.google.com/site/ngaineuro/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Our lab is interested in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the function, development and regeneration of the vertebrate olfactory system. We use a wide range of experimental tools and model systems, including molecular biology, genomics, computational biology and behavior to study these processes using the mouse and zebrafish as model systems. We are also developing genomics and genome engineering technologies to characterize the neuronal diversity in the cerebral cortex and other regions of the nervous system. Current Projects Olfactory Stem Cells and Neural Regeneration. In the vertebrate olfactory system, primary sensory neurons are continuously regenerated throughout adult life via the proliferation and differentiation of multipotent neural progenitor cells. This feature makes the olfactory system particularly amenable for studies on adult neurogenesis and the properties of neuronal stem cells. Olfactory sensory neurons normally turn over every 30-60 days and are replaced through the proliferation and differentiation of multipotent progenitor cells. Following injury that results in the destruction of mature cells in the olfactory epithelium, these adult tissue stem cells proliferate and differentiate to reconstitute all cellular constituents of this sensory epithelium. The regenerative capacity of the olfactory epithelium represents a powerful and experimentally accessible paradigm for understanding the regulation of neural stem cell function under normal conditions and during injury-induced regeneration. While distinct stages of the olfactory lineage have been identified, however, much remains to be learned about the genetic programs that both define and regulate olfactory neurogenesis during development and regeneration. Current projects are using a variety of approaches – including targeted gene knockouts to assess the function of transcription factors and stem cell factors, and single cell RNA sequencing – to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating olfactory stem cells and olfactory neurogenesis in the mouse. Olfactory Behavior. An understanding of the neural circuits underlying innate behaviors is required for an eventual understanding of the causes of human conditions such as chronic fear and anxiety. Many innate behaviors begin with the reception of a sensory stimulus and subsequent processing of diverse and complex inputs by the brain. In the olfactory system, pheromones can excite specific receptors in select neurons to cause a fixed action response. We are using the zebrafish as an experimental model for elucidating the networks driving sensory guided innate behaviors. Compared to mammalian species, zebrafish have a relatively simple and therefore experimentally tractable nervous system, and their fear behavior can be controlled by a small molecule alarm pheromone. This alarm pheromone causes an innate fear response mediated by the olfactory system. The alarm response shows many of the hallmarks of mammalian fear behaviors, and the behavior of adult and larval zebrafish to alarm pheromone is similar to a fear response generated by other sensory inputs. Moreover, zebrafish are amenable to genetic and chemical manipulation, and their embryos are transparent, which enables concurrent imaging and optogenetic control of neuronal network activity and assaying for fear behavior. The Ngai Lab BRAIN Initiative Project: Classification of Cortical Neurons by Single Cell Transcriptomics. A major goal of neuroscience is to understand how circuits of neurons and non-neuronal cells process sensory information, generate movement, and subserve memory, emotion and cognition. Elucidating the properties of neural circuits requires an understanding of the cell types that comprise these circuits and their roles in processing and integrating information. However, since the description of diverse neuronal cell types over a century ago by Ramon y Cajal, we have barely scratched the surface of understanding the diversity of cell types in the brain and how each individual cell type contributes to nervous system function. Current approaches for classifying neurons rely upon features including the differential expression of small numbers of genes, cell morphology, anatomical location, physiology, and connectivity – important descriptive properties that nonetheless are insufficient to fully describe or predict the vast number of different cell types that comprise the mammalian brain. This NIH-supported BRAIN Initiative project – a collaboration between the Ngai lab and 9 other research groups at UC Berkeley – aims to provide a suite of technologies for identifying and classifying the diverse cell types in the mammalian nervous system.

After a brief stay at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he spent a year as a postdoc at Caltech. He then went to Harvard as an assistant professor of astronomy for three years, and in 1974 he joined the Physics and Astronomy Departments here at Berkeley. He served as the first Director of the Theoretical Astrophysics Center in 1985, and from 1985-1998 he directed the Space Sciences Laboratory. He was Chair of the Physics Department from 2000-2004. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he has been both a Miller Professor and a Guggenheim Fellow. He was the co-chair of the 2000 decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. Research Interests Much of my research focuses on how stars form out of the diffuse interstellar medium of galaxies. This problem is conceptually challenging because of the wide variety of physical processes involved and because it involves complex nonlinear interactions. In some cases these problems must be addressed computationally, and in that case the challenge comes from the wide range of scales involved. Current Projects Formation of the First Stars. The initial conditions for the formation of the first stars are detemined by the primordial density fluctuations from the Big Bang. It is believed that these stars were very massive, 100-1000 times more massive than the Sun. The star\\'s mass determines whether it ends up as a black hole, or whether it ejects most of its mass back into the ambient medium in form of heavy elements. I am studying how feedback from the radiation emitted by these stars could limit their masses, and how this radiation could influence the formation of the next generation of stars. Formation of Star Clusters. Most stars form in clusters. As the stars form, they inject an enormous amount of energy into the cluster by means of powerful magnetized jets. Massive stars also emit copious amounts of ionizing radiation. This stellar feedback alters the conditions in the gas out of which the stars are forming, and may accelerate or quench further star formation. We are investigating these processes in a wide variety of conditions and comparing our results with the observed properties of star clusters. Numerical Studies of Star Formation. Although analytic and semi-analytic approaches are valuable in shedding light on the underlying physics of star formation, a computational approach is generally required to solve the nonlinear problems that arise. To do this, Richard Klein and I are carrying out numerical simulations with the technique of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), in which the computational effort is automatically concentrated in regions of strong spatial gradients. We have used this code to study how poweful interstellar shock waves can influence star fomation, and to determine the rate at which stars can accrete gas from a turbulent medium. Most stars are observed to be in binaries; what leads to this outcome? The luminosity of very massive stars is so high that radiation pressure should prevent them from forming in the first place; how does Nature overcome this difficulty? Our students and postdocs are using 3D simulations with radiative transfer to address these problems. Publications C.F. McKee & J.C.

       " 'John G. Flannery': 'John G. Flannery Contact Info Professor of Neurobiology Lab Homepage: http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/flannery/ Full Directory Information Research Interests Molecular Biology and Gene Therapies for Inherited Retinal Degenerations Inherited forms of retinal degeneration, which afflict 1 in 3000 people worldwide, arise primarily from mutations in transcripts expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells. The outer retina is therefore the primary target for ocular gene therapies. Photoreceptor degeneration is a very genetically heterogeneous disorder; with mutations in over 200 loci identified. Our laboratory focuses on understanding the genetic and mechanistic underpinning of photoreceptor degeneration, and developing rational therapies for these blinding conditions. The genetic and biochemical diversity of photoreceptor degnereration presents major challenges for therapy as there are many pathways to cell death. Gene therapy has great potential for treating retinal diseases including glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and inherited photoreceptor diseases.  To date, most gene therapies have targeted monogenic recessive retinal diseases and employed viral vectors to transfer a \\'normal \\' copy of the mutated gene to the affected cell. We are currently developing animal models of inherited retinal diseases to study the disease processes. In parallel, we are designing viral mediated therapies for autosomal dominant and recessive retinal degnenerations. Current Projects The retina is a complex tissue in the back of the eye that contains the rod and cone photoreceptor cells. The photoreceptors connect to a network of retinal interneurons. The adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) supports many of the retina\\'s metabolic functions. The retina is susceptible to a number of blinding diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and other inherited retinal degenerations. The inherited retinal degenerations are typified by retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which results in blindness from destruction of photoreceptor cells, and the RPE. This group of conditions affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States. To date, more than 130 genes causing inherited retinopathies in humans have been identified. This makes it possible to identify the cause of RP in approximately 50 percent of patients and the cause of Usher syndrome in 75 percent of patients. Gene identifications in humans have allowed us to examine the biochemical pathways in these diseases. In addition, gene identification in patients permits us to identify naturally occurring animal models or create new transgenic or knockout animal models with retinal degeneration due to defects in the gene homologs. In particular, we have the examined retinal degeneration in the naturally arising rd mouse strains (defects in the b-subunit of phosphodiesterase). We have also developed transgenic rats, expressing dominant rhodopsin mutations. Most recently we have developed a knockout mouse model of Usher syndrome type 3, which caused progressive blindness and deafness in patients. These animal models are the subject of study to determine the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby these gene defects lead to photoreceptor degeneration and hopefully will lead to pilot studies of novel therapies for retinal degeneration. Development of effective treatments for retinal diseases. With increasing insight into the molecular etiologies of several inherited retinal and macular dystrophies, studies from ours and many laboratories have defined several promising therapeutic strategies. Current projects in our lab involve development of retinal cell specific viral vectors based upon lentivirus and adeno-associated viruses. In previous work, we have demonstrated significant slowing of photoreceptor degeneration in several animal models following gene transfer of neurotrophic agents. Another promising strategy for dominantly inherited retinal diseases involves directly targeting the mutant mRNA product using Talens, CRISPR , and siRNA constructs. For recessive null diseases, gene replacement is an option. We find that gene therapy has vast potential for treating and potentially curing a number of inherited photoreceptor diseases. However, gene delivery technologies require significant improvements in cellular targeting, efficiency, and safety before promising findings in animal studies are translated to the clinic. In particular, for retinal gene therapy it would be highly advantageous to transduce a single cell type that spans the entire retina after an intravitreal injection of a gene delivery vehicle for the subsequent secretion of a general neuroprotective factor throughout the retina. Unfortunately, there is no vector capable of efficiently infecting the cell type that meets these needs, Muller cells. Vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) have proven themselves to be highly promising in numerous retinal disease models, but they are also incapable of Muller cell infection. Recently, we have developed novel lentiviral vectors with new properties, including altered receptor binding, which are capable of efficient Muller cell transduction. In parallel, the basic mechanisms of AAV transduction of Muller cells will be explored in order to develop new AAV pseudotypes capable of Muller cell transduction. The novel approaches developed in this work will have general impact for the molecular engineering of enhanced viral gene delivery vehicles, and future work will focus on testing these vectors in an animal model of retinal disease.

To see and to create our environment from the inside (the self) out and the outside (the other) in requires more intimately from us as a collective than propositions and solutions from any model architect can ultimately offer. Biography Professor Bourdier is the co-author of African Spaces and Drawn from African Dwellings . Production designer and co-director of seven films directed by Trinh T. Minh-ha. Painting exhibitions and photographs of ephemeral sculptures and body art widely exhibited nationally, winning fourteen national and international competitions. Awards include Guggenheim, American Council of Learned Societies, NEA Graham, UC President's Humanities, and Getty. Practice: see my slides (in Architecture Visual Resources Library).

Research Biomechanics:mechanical behavior of bone, finite element modeling and experimentation, design of bone-implant systems, tissue engineering Current Lab Research - Noah Bonnheim and Jonathan McKinley are investigating the micromechanics of the human spine. They are exploring the relationship between load transfer and implant design for total disc replacements utilizing micro-CT based finite element modeling. In addition to load transfer to native anatomy, Noah and Jonathan are focusing on the mechanics of the latest generation Total Disc Replacements (TDR) designed to mimic the native compliance of the intervertebral disc between the verterbal bodies. Total Disc Replacements are an emerging new class of spinal implants designed to preserve rather than limit vertebral joint mobility. -The Automotive Safety Biomechanics (ASB) team's research revolves around automotive safety, specifically how your body responds to a severe crash. We use a very advanced FEA model of the human body in different accident scenarios in an attempt to understand injury mechanisms and to advance safety in the automotive industry. We look at out-of-position driving and how it changes your chances of injury during a crash. We work very closely with leading industry representatives and experts in FEA, automotive, and crash safety. - Saghi Sadoughi constructs 3-D finite element (FE) models of bone structures using high-resolution micro-CT scans to investigate the biomechanical behavior of bone under different loading configurations. Specifically, she is looking at the role of trabecular orientation in vertebral strength and the role of tissue-level ductility in hip and spine fractures. - Megan Pendleton 's research focuses on investigating the effects of ionizing radiation on the material properties of bone. This is important because ionizing radiation has been shown to increase risk of fracture in areas of the body that have been exposed to high doses of radiation during radiotherapy treatment of some cancers. NASA is also interested in this research because as they work toward exploration missions outside low-Earth orbit, astronauts will be exposed to increasing levels of cosmic radiation. To ensure mission safety and success we need to understand the impact of radiation on risk of bone fracture. Publications To view a list of Professor Keaveny's publications, please click here .

       " 'Michael Crommie': 'Research Area(s): Condensed Matter Physics And Materials Science Biography Mike Crommie received a B.S. degree in physics from UCLA in 1984 and his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 1991. He was a post-doc at IBM Almaden for two years before becoming an Assistant Professor in the Physics Dept. at Boston University in 1994. He moved his laboratory to the UC Berkeley Physics Dept. in 6/99 and joined the Berkeley faculty as an Associate Professor. Awards and honors include a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award (1994), the AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize for 1993-94, and a Sloan Foundation Fellowship (1997). Research Interests My main research interests lie in exploring the local electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of atomic and molecular structures at surfaces. I am interested in studying how local interactions between atomic-scale structures affect their microscopic behavior, and how quantum mechanical effects might influence nanodevice behavior in very small structures. My main experimental tool is scanned probe microscopy, which can be used in combination with other experimental tools to both fabricate atomic-scale structures and probe them spectroscopically. Current Projects Atomic manipulation: The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can be used to position individual atoms and molecules on a conducting surface, allowing the fabrication of precise atomic-scale structures. We have several instruments capable of performing atomic and molecular manipulation, and we are currently exploring the physical parameters necessary to controllably position atoms and molecules into new and useful nanoscale configurations. Carbon Nanostructures: Recent advances in synthesis have made it possible to fabricate whole new classes of carbon nanostructures such as buckyballs, endohedral fullerenes, nanotubes, and single sheets of graphene. These materials are extremely flexible and hold great promise for new generations of nanodevices. My group is using scanned probe techniques to explore and modify the properties of these materials at the single atom / single molecule level. Some of our successes include the first energy-resolved mapping of a single buckyball, single-atom electronic doping of an individual C60 molecule, mapping electron-phonon coupling strength across the surface of a single endohedral fullerene, and the first atomically-resolved spectroscopy of a single layer of graphene. Future projects will include exploring atomic-scale modification of carbon nanostructures and investigation of their device potential. Spin-based Nanostructures: When magnetic structures are shrunk down to single-atom or single-molecule sizes, then quantum spin effects dominate their behavior. This is a particularly fascinating regime in condensed matter, where individual spins can interact with the excitations of the condensed matter environment. Much of the interest in this area derives from its great promise for revolutionary applications in spintronics and quantum information. My group is using scanned probe techniques to explore individual magnetic atoms, small spin clusters, and magnetic molecules. Some of our successes here include the first spectroscopic characterization of a single Kondo impurity, exploration of coupled systems of two and three atomic spins at a surface, and the first spin-polarized measurement of a single magnetic adatom. We are currently exploring spin-polarized atomic-scale structures and coupled magnetic molecule systems with an eye toward quantum information applications. Molecular Machines: Molecular machines are well-known to exist in the biological realm, but it has proved difficult to control the mechanical behavior of synthetically fabricated machines at truly molecular scales. Nevertheless, this is a very promising direction with many exciting NEMS applications (Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems). In my group we are interested in creating molecular machines from the ground up by assembling and actuating molecular-mechanical building blocks. One of our successes includes the first observation of reversible optically-actuated mechanical switching of a single molecule (azobenzene) at a surface. We are currently exploring the physics of new molecular systems whose electro-mechanical state can be remotely switched, and our goal is to assemble these into functional molecular machines at small lengthscales. Nano-photovoltaics: Current state-of-the-art solar cells require carefully processed semiconducting interfaces that extend over macroscopic distances (i.e., extended n-p junctions). An alternative method for creating solar cells, however, is to engineer nanoscale elements that can be combined to create microscopic n-p junctions. These can then be combined in large quantities to create composite photovoltaics with spatially distributed n-p interfaces. A benefit of this approach is that such nano-photovoltaic building blocks can be mass-produced cheaply and so this technique is potentially more scalable than current state-of-the-art semiconductor photovoltaics. The down side is that nano-photovoltaics currently have very low efficiencies. My group is currently exploring the microscopic physics of nano-photovoltaic interfaces, with the goal of understanding and optimizing the processes that allow us to convert sunlight into usable electrical energy in molecular-scale structures.

Lemaux Crop Biotechnology Cooperative Extension Specialist 411B Koshland Hall Berkeley, California 94720 Phone 510.642.1589 Lab Phone 510.642.1589 Fax 510.642.4995 lemauxpg@berkeley.edu Research Recent Publications Honors and Awards Outreach web site: ucbiotech.org Ph.D. University of Michigan, 1977 B.S. Miami University, 1968 CV Cooperative Extension Specialist Peggy Lemaux’s laboratory performs both basic and applied research focused primarily on cereal crops, like sorghum, wheat, rice and barley. The objectives of these studies are to better understand crop plants and to use that knowledge to improve their performance and quality. More recently efforts with colleagues have focused on bioenergy – especially in the versatile feedstock, sorghum. In addition to research, Lemaux develops educational resources on food and agriculture that are disseminated to professionals, the media and consumers. These resources include an award-winning website ( http://ucbiotech.org ) that has afterschool curricula for middle school students, educational displays and games, videos, PowerPoint presentations and fact sheets. In 2015 the Global Food Initiative, through the UC Office of the President, provided resources for the CLEAR (Communication, Literacy and Education for Agricultural Research) program. This effort focuses on mentoring undergrads, grads and postdocs to engage in science-based communication with the media, legislators and the general public. Outreach Website Research Use of genetic strategies to understand and improve cereals and grasses The Lemaux laboratory focuses on development and use of genetic and genomic technologies for monocotyledonous species, wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ), barley ( Hordeum vulgare ), and rice ( Oryza sativa ). Long-term objectives are to use these technologies to study gene function, explore basic biological questions and to improve crops. Methods for stably transforming cereal crops are more routine today than decades ago, but challenges still exist. Nearly all methods utilize in vitro - tissue culture materials, which leads directly or indirectly to limitations in varieties that can be transformed, to somaclonal variation and to transgene expression instability. Most cereal transformation efforts involve culturing immature embryos to generate embryogenic or organogenic tissue. This approach has been successful for model genotypes but has been challenging for other varieties of interest.For this reason, our laboratory developed other culturing methods, including new target tissues, like cultured adventitious meristems and highly regenerable, green tissue (right), a developmental stage between embryogenic and organogenic tissue. Using these methods, we developed efficient transformation systems for previously recalcitrant varieties of wheat, barley, corn, rice, oat, sorghum and forage and turf grasses (e.g., Cho et al., 1998 , 1999a ; Ha et al., 2001 ; Cho et al., 2000a ; Cho et al., 2000b ; Zhang et al., 1999 , 2002b ; Gurel et al., 2009 ). Presently we are implementing a “game-changing” technology, developed at Pioneer Hi-Bred. It involves introducing developmental genes, babyboom and wuschel , that reset cells to an early developmental stage, leading to transformation success with more cultivars and the use of explants, like seeds and leaves ( Lowe et al. 2016. Plant Cell 28:1998–2015 ). Another focus of the lab relates to functional genomics. For these efforts in barley, we used the maize transposable element, Ds , and its transposase gene (with P. Bregitzer, USDA-ARS). When these two elements are present in the same cell, Ds is activated and transposes preferentially to genic regions ( Koprek et al., 2001 ; Brown et al., 2014 ). Inverse PCR was used to sequence flanking DNA, identify the gene into which Ds inserted and to map its location ( Cooper et al., 2004 ; Singh et al., 2006 ). Efforts have continued to identify tagged genes in barley ( Brown et al., 2014). With effective transformation methods, transgenic cereals were created that over- and under-expressed elements of the NADPH thioredoxin (Trx) system (with B. Buchanan, UCB). To achieve maximal grain Trx overexpression, we used seed-specific promoters and vacuolar targeting to direct transgene expression to protein bodies of the endosperm ( Cho et al., 1999b ; Cho, M.-J., Lemaux P.G., Buchanan B.B. Production of proteins in plant seeds. Official Gazette of the United States Patent and Trademark Office Patents. Patent Number: US 07157629, January 2, 2007. The Regents of the University of California ). Homozygous Trx h5 transgenic barley seeds germinated faster, alpha-amylase levels rose earlier and levels of the starch-degrading enzyme, pullulanase, were higher ( Cho et al., 1999 ) - important traits for malting. In wheat, homozygous lines overexpressing Trx h5 had lowered allergenicity in the gliadin fraction, as assessed using a canine model ( Li et al., 2009 ), and improved dough quality with poor quality wheat flour (unpublished). Buildingon this work, Chinese collaborators, using an antisense approach for trx h9 ,demonstrated that this mitigated the devastation of preharvest sprouting. Using three years of data from field-grown plants, yield and dough quality of transgenic lines generally responded positively in both a low- and a high-gliadin variety. Earlier evidence in barley showed that changes in the endosperm caused effects in the embryo and aleurone. Work in Arabidopsis showed that trx h9 , unlike other thioredoxins, is located in the cell membrane and may function in cell-to-cell communication of the redox state ( Meng et al. 2010 ) - possibly functioning in communication between endosperm, embryo and aleurone. Recent work overexpressing Trx h5 in sorghum appears to lead to improved digestibility (Wong et al., unpublished), important becausesorghum flour is the least digestible of all cereals, particularly after cooking. Homozygous transgenic seed also appear to have increased seed size. To gene function studies in cereals, we developed transformation strategies for green foxtail ( Setaria viridis ), a fast-cycling, diploid C4 monocot. In 2015 the lab started the EPICON project, funded by a 5-year DOE BER grant. The goal of this collaborative project, between UC Berkeley, UCANR, the Joint Genome Institute and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, is to use transcriptomics and epigenetics to develop an in-depth understanding of drought tolerance in Sorghum bicolor in the field. Recent studies have shown that environmental stresses – like drought – can lead to epigenetic changes, allowing plants to respond to changing environments more quickly. Specifically it is well known that associations of specific bacteria and fungi with plants have positive effects on plant fitness. EPICON researchers will also track changes in the sorghum-associated microbial communities to determine whether they correlate with changes that directly contribute to the crop\\'s drought tolerance. Drought The duration and intensity of drought is increasing in California and worldwide largely due to climate change. Faculty member Peggy Lemaux is leading a $12.3 million Department of Energy Biological and Environmental Research-funded project to examine how the drought- tolerant cereal crop, sorghum, survives water limitation. Lemaux and fellow PMB researchers John Taylor, Devin Coleman-Derr and John Vogel, are partnering with Elizabeth Purdom, Department of Statistics, Jeff Dahlberg and Robert Hutmacher, directors of ANR Research Stations, Axel Visel from DOE’s Joint Genome Institute and Christer Jansson, at DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Five Year Project This five-year project, “Epigenetic Control of Drought Response in Sorghum\" (EPICON), comes in the midst of an historic drought in California. During three years of field-testing, researchers will investigate responses of sorghum to drought, including how gene expression changes at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, which proteins and metabolites are altered and interactions with its microbiome. \"Historically, the genetic manipulation of crops, which is critical to increasing agricultural productivity, has concentrated on altering the plant’s genetic sequence, encoded in its DNA,\" said Lemaux. \"However, recent studies have shown that environmental stresses – in our case drought – can lead to epigenetic changes in a plant’s genetic information. Because epigenetic changes occur without altering the underlying DNA sequence, they allow plants to respond to a changing environment more quickly.\" It is now well known that associations of specific bacteria and fungi with plants have positive effects on plant fitness. EPICON researchers will also track changes in the sorghum-associated microbial communities to determine whether they correlate with changes that directly contribute to the crop\\'s drought tolerance. EPICON researchers will develop better predictions about how sorghum and other cereal crops are affected by future climate scenarios, leading to approaches to improve crop growth and production under water-limiting conditions. Outreach Interests As a Cooperative Extension Specialist, I have statewide responsibility for outreach and educational programming related to agriculture and food. These efforts are designed to increase public understanding of agricultural practices, food production and the impact of new technologies, including biotechnology and genome editing, on food and agriculture. Educational programming and resources that are developed include development of an award winning, website, http://ucbiotech.org , which provides science-based information and resources. Two articles related to these efforts were published in Annual Review of Plant Biology , “Genetically Engineered Crops and Foods: A Scientist\\'s Analysis of the Issues. Part I and II ( Lemaux PG. 2008 ; 2009 ). With my long-time assistant, B. Alonso, we created games, displays, videos and middle-school afterschool curricula, DNA for Dinner , Backyard Mystery and Learning Plant Biology: It’s All in the Touch . A recent project, CLEAR ( C ommunication, L iteracy, E ducation for A gricultural R esearch) was initiated with funds from UCOP’s Global Food Initiative. CLEAR aims to enable undergrads, grads and postdocs with skills in communicating about science with the media, legislators and the public. CLEAR fellows write pieces for the popular press, organize roundtables, participate in outreach events and develop videos.

We focus on (1) The diversity of thioredoxin and its role in redox regulation in oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes and seeds, and (2) Applying thioredoxin to improve the quality and yield of cereals. Thioredoxin (Trx) is a disulfide protein found in all types of living cells. Discovered as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase, Trx has since been found to play a regulatory role in a spectrum of processes throughout biology. The protein is also finding a place in medicine and biotechnology. Diversity of Trx systems with an emphasis on their role in anaerobic archaea and bacteria and oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes.

My research thus involves these areas: (1) botanical bibliography, biography, and history, especially of the period 1870-1945; (2) the flora and vegetation of California and adjacent areas, especially Baja California; (3) the flora and vegetation of New Caledonia; (4) conservation and threatened taxa, especially concerning gymnosperms; (5) systematic anatomy, including taxonomy, of anomalous taxa and sundry families such as Actinidiaceae, Burmanniaceae, Capparaceae, Labiatae, Pinaceae, Pyrolaceae, Scheuchzeriaceae, Triuridaceae, and especially Myrtaceae; (6) functional and comparative anatomy and morphology of wood, nectaries, flowers, fruits, and seeds, especially of their vascular systems. Doctoral research sponsored has included: phylogenetics in Polypodiales (Pteridophyta), especially in Blechnaceae; succession and evolution of seedling morphology in lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta var. latifolia ); floral ontogeny and the divergence of reproductive morphologies in Eucnide (Loasaceae); heteroblastic seedlings of green ash ( Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. subintegerrima ); systematics of Parnassia (Parnassiaceae)--generic overview and revision of North American taxa; longevity and development of needles of Pinus longaeva (bristlecone pine) and other conifers; the development and function of chasmogamy in Lamium amplexicaule (Labiatae).

       " 'Bob Jacobsen': 'Research Area(s): Particle Physics Biography Bob obtained a B.S.E.E. from MIT in 1978. He spent 1976 through 1986 working in the computer and data communications industry for a small company that was successively bought out by larger and larger companies. He left in 1986 to return to graduate school in physics, obtaining his Ph.D. in experimental high energy physics from Stanford in 1991. From 1991 through 1994, he was a Scientific Associate and Scientific Staff Member at CERN, the European Laboratory for Nuclear Physics, in Geneva Switzerland. While there, he was a member of the ALEPH collaboration concentrating on B physics and on the energy calibration of the LEP collider. He joined the faculty at Berkeley in 1995. Research Interests Fundamental particle physics, particularly from the experimental perspective, is my primary research interest. Over the past 20 years the “Standard Model” of high energy physics has triumphed in precise tests of predictions of various quantities. The next step is to learn more about the unknown parameters, particularly in the neutrino sector, and to search for hints to the remaining phenomenological mysteries: Dark Energy and Dark Matter. The LHC collider and experiments provides one powerful approach to these next steps. But it’s also possible to make progress with smaller projects that address specific questions. For example, a number of different techniques are being used, and new ones are being proposed, for experimental searches for dark matter. My interest lies with using very quiet targets, for example heavily-shielded and high pure targets of liquid Xenon, and watching them with high-sensitivity phototube arrays to detect possible interactions with dark matter particles as they transit through the Earth. Much like the initial solar neutrino experiments of decades ago, this is an exercise in careful understanding of backgrounds and observation of very small, low-rate signals with high confidence levels. Experimentally, it’s hard, but also a lot of fun. From a physics perspective, confirmed observations of dark matter particles would open up an entirely new window on fundamental physics. Current Projects The LUX detector is located 4850 feet underground at the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota. In 2013 it published the best-yet limits on WIMP-type dark matter. In 2014 and 2015 we’ll have a longer run to gather more data, along with new calibration methods to improve our ability to understand that data. After that, the next step is a larger detector, called “LZ”. This 6+ tonne liquid Xenon detector will replace LUX in the cavern, and provide a large improvement in sensitivity. It’s being designed now (2014) and will be constructed at LBL and other sites over the next few years. We expect “first dark”, the initial operation, some time in 2018. Publications R.

Feel free to drop in. Home Academic Background Research Interests Teaching Selected Publications Rudy Wenk joined the Department in 1967. His research is in crystallography, mineralogy, structural geology and rock deformation. Most recently (see research interests and publications), emphasis has been on understanding seismic anisotropy in the earth by investigating the development of preferred orientation under expreme conditions (temperature and pressure) with neutron diffraction, synchrotron x-rays and electron microscopy. The research is funded by NSF and DOE. He wrote an introductory mineralogy book, published by CambridgeUniversity Press. A new edition will appear in summer 2016. 1965 PhD in crystallography at the University of Zurich. 1967 Joined faculty at UC Berkeley. Mineralogy-Crystallography. Microstructures in minerals developing during deformation and phase transformations. In the past much work has been dedicated to feldspars, carbonates and perovskites. More recently cement minerals have become a fascinating topic of analysis (with Paulo Monteiro, Civil Engineering). Anisotropy-Texture Development. Presently research emphasis is on investigating the development of preferred orientation in rocks and man-made materials. Close collaborations with materials scientists have been most rewarding. The approach is to balance modelling with experiments to better understand the development of anisotropy in the deep Earth. With diamond anvil experiments (mainly done at ALS and APS) materials can not only be subjected to high pressure and temperature, but simultaneously they can be deformed and texture development can be observed in situ. Anisotropy changes during phase transformations (e.g.olivine transforming to spinel and perovskite in the mantle, bcc iron transforming to hcp iron, trigonal quartz transforming to hexagonal quartz) are fascinating new topics that become available for investigations with new instrumental techniques. A new research emphasis is on quantification of preferred orientation in shales with synchrotron X-ray diffraction, relevant to seismic prospecting. Field Investigations. Though most complex, natural rocks provide a lot of insight into basic mechanisms as well as a larger context for detailed studies. Presently fieldwork concentrates on the EasternPeninsular Ranges in Southern California with magnificent mylonites and a huge zone of pseudotachylites that appear related to ancient seismic activity. He is starting projects to investigate effects of shock deformation on quartz at meteorite impact sites as well as similar features in samples from the San Andreas fault drill core (SAFOD). Other projects continue in the central Alps and Japan. Fieldwork also provides an outlet for Rudy Wenk\\'s hobby interests in mountain climbing and mountaineering. Facilities. Rudy Wenk is maintaining a comprehensive Texture Laboratory with instruments (pole figure goniometers, an EBSP scanning electron microscope) and software (BEARTEX) �and is principal investigator of the Los Alamos neutron time-of-flight University of California Materials Research Diffractometer project HIPPO (High Pressure Preferred Orientation) at LANSCE. Synchrotron X-rays play an increasing role in the quantification of microstructural features (ALS, APS and ESRF). Support: The research is currently supported by NSF,DOE-BES and DOE (CDAC).

Granholm': \"About In the News Areas of Expertise Law Energy, Renewable and Clean Energy Labor and Employment Politics Economics of Industry Manufacturing and Job Markets Biography Jennifer Granholm served as Michigan's 47th governor from 2003 to 2011. As Governor, Granholm led the state through a brutal economic downturn that resulted from a meltdown in the automotive and manufacturing sectors. She worked relentlessly to diversify the state’s economy, strengthen its auto industry, preserve the manufacturing sector, and add new, emerging sectors, such as clean energy, to Michigan’s economic portfolio. During her tenure, she pioneered clean energy policies, working with business and labor, Republicans and Democrats to create new economic opportunities in Michigan. In 2005, the Granholm economic development team put together an aggressive strategy to make Michigan the hub of clean-energy development in North America by developing entire supply chains in Michigan, fostering critical partnerships between industry, government and researchers and by creating economic incentives that made Michigan the place to locate. Granholm’s plan included specific clustering strategies targeted at battery manufacturing, bio-energy, solar, and wind power. Her leadership attracted to Michigan more than 89,000 clean energy jobs and $9.4 billion in investments in that sector. After leaving office, Granholm served as an advisor to Pew Charitable Trusts’ Clean Energy Program, where she led a national campaign for clean energy policies. She also hosted Current TV’s political news analysis show “The War Room with Jennifer Granholm” and co-authored A Governor’s Story: The Fight for Jobs and America’s Economic Future , which tells how Michigan pioneered ways out of an economic storm and offers proven advice for a nation desperate to create jobs. The book, which she wrote with her husband, Dan Mulhern, became a Washington Post political bestseller shortly after its release. Granholm is an honors graduate of both the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard Law School. She and her husband have three children.

       " 'Frank Bezner': 'Frank Bezner, Classics (and Program in Medieval Studies) – specializes in medieval and early-modern Latin literature and intellectual history. A major area of his research lies in the so-called “Renaissance of the Twelfth Century”, a crucial phase in the history of post-classical Latin literature: here, his his publications include a book on allegory and literary theory in the 12th century (Vela Veritatis, Brill, 2005) and articles on Abelard, hagiography, or the reception of Plato. A second research interest lies in a genealogy of early-modern historiography – a field in which he co-edited a volume (Zwischen Wissen und Politik, Heidelberg: Winter, 2011) and published a monograph on a 16th century history written by a Benedictine monk; this book – which includes a critical edition with translation and commentary, an analysis of the transmission of the work, and an interpretation of the rhetorics of historicity within the text – illustrates his interest in material philology understood as an integration of philology and literary/cultural criticism. Most of his courses are meant as offers to students to explore the “terra incognita” of medieval and early-modern (Latin) literary culture; topics include: medieval allegory; Abelard and Heloise; genealogies of desire in the Middle Ages; introduction into medieval Latin literature; material philology (paleography, codicology).

Studies in Luan Lab have identified a new molecular network for calcium signal transduction in plants. Downstream of these early signaling events, plants respond and adapt to environmental changes by regulating the biochemical processes including those at the plasma membrane, vacuolar membrane, and in the chloroplasts. Research Signal Transduction and Chloroplast Biology Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanism underlying plant response and adaptation to its environment. Because higher plants can not “walk away” from their environment, they have evolved elaborate mechanisms to integrate their outside world into the program of their life cycle control. When environmental conditions change, plants rapidly perceive those changes and respond by physiological and developmental changes that would help themselves adapt to the “new” environment. We are interested in revealing the molecular networks that connect the environmental input to the intracellular responses in plants. The understanding of biochemical pathways that allow plants to adapt to constantly changing environment is also among our primary research goals. Environmental Sensing through the CBL-CIPK Ca 2+ Signaling Network Upon environmental changes, a plant cell has a number of rapid responses. One of these is fluctuation of cellular Ca 2+ that is often required for the further downstream responses and is thus referred to as a “second messenger”. A critical question regarding calcium signaling is how a simple cation serves as a messenger for so many different signals leading to distinct responses. The key step is signal “sensing”, i.e., the calcium signal is sensed by proteins functioning as Ca 2+ sensors. These sensors bind Ca 2+ and change their conformation/function. Luan Lab recently discovered a family of novel Ca 2+ sensors (CBLs) from Arabidopsis. The CBL-type Ca 2+ sensors function by interacting with and regulating a family of protein kinases (CIPKs) in a number of signaling pathways. At least 10 members of CBLs interact with 25 CIPKs, forming a large number of molecular complexes that interpret the calcium signals in plant cells. The functional specificity, synergism, and antagonism among various CBLs and CIPKs constitute a complex signaling network for cellular regulation and crosstalk. CBL-CIPK in nutrient sensing : Plants are growing in a nutrient-poor environment especially after a long history of farming. Agricultural production is heavily relying on the application of chemical fertilizers, opposing a serious economic and environmental problem worldwide. One solution would be to breed crops that can tolerate low-nutrient soils without the need of fertilizers. Recent work in Luan laboratory identified a CBL-CIPK signaling pathway that regulates the activity of a voltage-gated potassium channels involved in K-uptake in plant roots. Manipulation of CBL-CIPK network can therefore enhance the growth of plants under low-K soils, impacting agriculture and environment. (See Li et al., 2006 to get started on this subject). Furthermore, CBL-CIPK network also regulates nutrient homeostasis through targeting transport processes across the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane). This mechanism is exemplified by high Mg-detoxification mediated by multiple CBL-CIPK complexes associated with tonoplast (Tang et al., 2012; 2015). CBL-CIPK in stress and ABA responses :Several CBL-CIPK pathways have been identified that function in plant responses to environmental stress conditions including salt, drought, and cold. CBL-CIPK network is also involved in the response to plant hormones such as ABA that regulates stress responses. The crosstalk and interaction among the CBLs and CIPKs form a complex signaling network that links environmental responses to biochemical processes in plant cells. (See Cheong et al., 2003 and Pandey et al., 2004 to get started on this subject). Energy Conversion and Metabolic Regulation in Chloroplasts After environmental signals are perceived and interpreted by signaling pathways, plant cells respond to the signals by biochemical and physiological changes downstream of the signaling process. Many of the biochemical changes in plants involve metabolic processes in the chloroplasts that serve as a critical “factory” for plant productivity. The best known photosynthetic process include both light harvesting by the photosystems and carbon fixation. As the most important metabolic process, photosynthetic activity and its regulation are connected to all environmental changes. Although the basic biochemical pathways are largely known, the regulatory pathways that link the environmental signals to the light and dark reactions are poorly understood. Luan laboratory focus on the mechanisms underlying regulation of photosynthetic activity by environmental signals. Light reaction and bio-energy conversion: We are interested in the mechanism of assembly and maintenance of the photosystems that harvest light energy and convert it into the chemical forms. Our recent studies have discovered a family of protein foldases and chaperones (called immunophilins) in the chloroplast that function in the assembly and maintenance of photosynthetic electron transport complexes. Because maintaining the function of photosynthetic complexes is one of the limiting factors in photosynthetic activity, our findings on the immunophilins in the chloroplast will provide information for enhancing light energy conversion by plants.This project has been a collaboration with Prof. Bob B. Buchanan (See Lima et al., 2006; Fu et al., 2007; Che et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2015 to get started on this subject). Dark Reaction and Biomass: The output of photosynthetic carbon fixation is transitory starch in the chloroplast. The starch biosynthesis and degradation is under tight control by environmental factors such as light-dark cycle and stress conditions. Although regulation of glycogen (starch) metabolism is well understood in animal cells, our understanding of metabolic regulation of starch accumulation is still in its infancy. Recent research in Luan laboratory identified a protein phosphatase (DSP4) that plays a central role in regulating starch accumulation in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, providing a strong evidence that protein phosphorylation is involved in starch regulation. In addition, the DSP4 activity is regulated by redox states that are controlled by light-dark transition. Therefore DSP4 may provide a molecular link between diurnal cycle and starch accumulation. As starch is one of the most abundant plant-derived polymers, its sheer biomass and ease of production make it a critical source for biofuel production. Understanding the regulatory mechanism for starch accumulation in plants will directly impact the biomass production and biofuel industry.(See Sokolov et al., 2006 to get started on this subject). Genetic and Genomic Approaches to Dissecting the Mechanism of Low-K Tolerance in Crop Plants From findings in model plants such as Arabidopsis, Luan lab research extends into mechanism of low-K tolerance in crop plants especially in cereals. Recent studies focus on identifying the genes and gene networks that function in plant adaptation to low-K environment. Systems biology approaches are being taken to link signaling pathways including the CBL-CIPK networks to responses such as transport activities at the plasma membrane and tonoplast. The goal is to build a complete network of genes that allow plants to respond and adapt to the constantly changing nutrient status in the soil, facilitating breeding effort to produce crop plants with high yield under limited supply of nutrients, promoting sustainable agriculture.

       " 'Kunxin Luo': 'Kunxin Luo Contact Info Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology* *And Faculty Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Division of Life Sciences Full Directory Information Research Interests We are interested in the signal transduction pathways that regulate development and cancer. We employ in vitro mechanistic studies in tissue culture cells in combination with biological analyses using in vivo mouse models to understand how disruption of the normal signaling network leads to developmental defects and human cancer. Current Projects Currently, we focus on two important tumor suppressor pathways that also play important roles in regulating tissue development and homeostasis, the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)/Smad pathway and Hippo pathway. Since all intracellular signaling pathways eventually converge on the transcription machinery, and recent studies have shown that many developmental and growth regulatory genes are controled predominantly at the step of transcription elongation, we also investigate the specific function of various transcription elongation complexes in breast cancer progression. The TGFβ family of cytokines, functioning through the Smad proteins, plays important roles in vertebrate development, carcinogenesis and malignant progression as well as epithelial-stromal interaction. The Smad proteins are transcription factors that upon phosphorylation by the receptor kinases, accumulate in the nucleus and regulate the expression of target genes. The activity of the Smad proteins is subjected to regulation by various cellular co-factors. SnoN and the related Ski proteins are critical negative modulators of the Smads by binding to and repressing their transcription activities. SnoN and Ski play important and complex roles in embryonic development and possess both oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities by regulating the proliferation, survival and senescence of cells. In addition to modulating TGFβ signaling, SnoN can also activate the p53 pathway in response to various cellular stress signals, through which it regulates aging, tumor progression and tissue regeneration. More recently we show that both Ski and SnoN are important regulators of the Hippo pathway. We are interested in understanding the functions of SnoN and Ski and how they coordinate the actions of various signaling pathways, in various aspects of development and in tumorigenesis using a combination of tissue culture cell lines, three-dimentional cutlure models and in vivo mouse models. Our current research focused on the following areas: The role of TGFβ signaling/SnoN in mammary stem cell regulation and breast cancer In adult mammary gland, mammary epithelial cells undergo massive proliferation and differentiation during pregnancy and lactation to produce and secrete milk. Recent studies suggest that a group of luminal progenitor cells may give rise to alveolar and ductal epithelial cells that are crucial for these processes. Interestingly, the molecular signature of this luminal progenitor population is highly similar to that of the most aggressive basal breast cancer subtype, suggesting that these luminal progenitor cells may be the originals of these basal breast cancer. Thus, understanding how luminal progenitor cells are regulated and maintained is critical not only for understanding normal mammary gland function but also for the development and progression of breast cancer. Using a knockout mouse model, we recently showed that SnoN plays a critical role in the generation and differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells and is essential for the onset of lactation. Using this mouse model and in combination with a three-dimensional matrigel culture (3D) model, we are dissecting how SnoN co-ordinates TGFβ, prolactin and Hippo signaling to regulate the expansion, maintenance and differentiation of luminal progenitor cells, and how disruption of this process leads to breast cancer. Role of SnoN in regulation of aging and adipose tissue development We recently showed that mice expressing a mutant SnoN defective in antagonizing TGFß signaling exhibited premature aging with a shortened life span, decreased reproductivity, osteoporosis and reduced regenerative capacity, as well as resistance to tumorigenesis, similar to that found in mice expressing an active p53. Subsequently we found that indeed, SnoN can activate p53 in response to cellular stress signals to promote cell senescence and tumor suppression. In addition, these mice also displayed a markedly reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue. By combining phenotype analysis in vivo with biochemical studies in in vitro preadipocyte differentiation models, we are determining the signaling mechanisms by which SnoN regulates adipocyte differentiation. Regulation of Hippo signaling by SnoN/Ski during breast cancer progression Hippo pathway has recently been shown to regulate cell contact inhibition, organ size and cancer progression. Ski and SnoN appear to be important regulators of this pathway, in particularly, the activity of the TAZ/YAP proteins. We hypothesize that SnoN relays the signals from the cell polarity complexes to coordinate the activity of various intracellular signaling pathways. In breast cancer cells, this signaling crosstalk regulates the expansion of breast cancer stem cells and tumor progression. We are investigating these regulatory mechanisms. Function of the P-TEFb transcription elongation complexes in breast cancer progression The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) stimulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating Pol II and antagonizing negative elongation factors. In cells, P-TEFb exists in three complexes: the inhibitory 7SK snRNP that functions as areservoir of P-TEFb, the active Brd4 complex and the super elongation complex (SEC). We recently showed that P-TEFb activity is important for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) andplays a key role in promoting breast cancer progression by directly controlling the expression of upstream EMT and metastasis regulators. We are investigating how a general transcription complex exerts specific functions in promoting breast cancer EMT and metastasis.

       " 'Lisa Goldberg': \"Adjunct Professor Primary Research Area: Applied & Theoretical Statistics Sub-Focus: Applied Statistics, Bayesian Statistics, Statistics in Social Sciences, Theory of Statistics Research Interests: Financial economics, statistical evaluation of investment strategies, asset allocation, credit and counterparty risk, socially responsible investing Email: lrg [at] berkeley [dot] edu Office / Location: 339 Evans Hall One of my research areas concerns risk in levered strategies. For example, leverage in a risk parity strategy can be very expensive and unexpectedly volatile. The performance of a levered strategy can be attributed to coin-flip-like factors such as the covariance between leverage and the underlying source portfolio that is being levered. A levered investor is liable to get caught in a liquidity trap: unable to secure funding after an abruptmarket decline, he may be forced to sell valuable positions under unfavorable market conditions. A risk measure that is especially relevant to a levered investor is Conditional Expected Drawdown , which is the tail mean of a drawdown distribution, and which is sensitive to losses that are correlated over time. Ordinary least squares regression is used throughout finance, but the standard connection between the level of statisticalsignificanceof a coefficient and the magnitude of its t-statistic can break down if the data aren't Gaussian. There isa stunning example of an inflated t-statistic for a VIX-basedvolatilityfactor with no explanatory power. Counterparty risk is inherent in any financial contract, perhaps even in a US treasury bond. Prompted by regulation, banks use the Credit Value Adjust (CVA) to evaluate the market price of counterparty risk. Reduced form estimates of CVA may surprise practitioners and regulators in the presence of wrong way risk (when credit quality is negatively correlated with exposure). More research articles can be found on my SSRN page . I am co-Director of the Consortium For Data Analytics In Risk (CDAR), which was launched in 2015 with a generous grant from State Street . CDARperforms and disseminates research on the most important and pressing issues concerning financial markets and risk management.The Consortium supports a collaborative yet intellectually and geographically diverse group of researchers, and we aspire to integrate best practices from academia and industry.I am also Director of Researchat Aperio , which is a Sausalito-based wealth management firm. Aperio's recent research concerns minimum variance and quality strategies, as well as carbon-free investing .

Drawing from core disciplines of inorganic and organic chemistry and molecular biology, as well as emerging fields spanning chemical biology to materials and nanoscience, we develop new chemical tools for molecular imaging, chemoproteomics, and optogenetics to identify and study novel chemical signals in biology, with a particular focus on neuroscience, metabolism, and cancer. Our inorganic program centers on solar-to-chemical conversion, where we merge concepts and components of molecular inorganic chemistry with biology and materials science to synthesize catalysts that operate in environmentally-green, aqueous conditions. Bioinorganic Chemistry: Transition Metal Signaling. The traditional view of metals in biology is that redox-inactive alkali and alkaline metals like sodium, potassium, and calcium are broadly used for cell signaling, whereas redox-active transition metals like copper and iron are solely metabolic cofactors that must be buried and tightly-bound within protein active sites to protect the cell from potential oxidative stress and damage. Our work breaks this narrow mold by establishing a new paradigm of transition metal signaling, where these essential nutrients can also serve as dynamic cellular messengers. We are developing fluorescent, bioluminescent, and PET probes to image transition metal pools, chemoproteomics probes to identify and characterize new metalloprotein targets, and optogenetic constructs to manipulate transition metal signals in cell, tissue, and zebrafish and mouse models. These chemical tools are being applied to study the contributions of transition metal signaling to fat metabolism in obesity, diabetes, and cancer along with neural circuitry. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Metals in Neurobiology. The unique biology of the brain as the center of consciousness, from learning and memory to senses like sight, smell, and taste, is underpinned by unique chemistry that remains insufficiently understood. In particular, we are interested in understanding why the brain accumulates unexpected chemical elements at higher concentrations than any other organ or tissue, including redox-active metals like copper and iron, where at the same time these elements are misregulated in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and autism. Using CRISPR, optogenetics, high-resolution mass spec imaging, and behavioral assays, we are developing and studying new zebrafish and mouse models to explore the roles of transition metals in neural signaling and neurodegeneration. Chemical Biology: Redox Imaging, Proteomics, and Optogenetics. Traditional methods for sensing rely on static lock-and-key binding approaches, which are difficult to apply to reactive, transient small molecules in complex biological settings. We are synthesizing small-molecule fluorescent, MRI, and PET imaging probes that exploit chemoselective, bioorthogonal chemistries to report on specific analytes in living cells and animals, with particular interest in the redox biology of reactive oxygen, sulfur, and carbonyl species. We are also developing new bioconjugation reactions for chemoproteomics as well as small-molecule inhibitor and antibody-drug conjugate therapeutics. Finally, we are creating optogenetic tools for controlling redox signals that govern information transfer in neural circuits in live-cell culture and mouse models. Inorganic and Materials Chemistry: Energy Catalysis and Solar-to-Chemical Conversion. New catalysts for carbon-neutral energy conversion processes are essential to addressing climate change and rising global energy demands. We are taking a unified approach to this small-molecule activation problem by developing molecular inorganic, biological, and materials catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction and water splitting that can be used in parallel under environmentally green, aqueous conditions. Biology and materials science provide concepts as well as components to develop new solar-to-chemical conversion processes. Molecular materials derived from metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks and related porous cages, along with molecular-nanoparticle composites, complement molecular inorganic catalyst designs. Materials Biology. Our work at the materials biology interface is inspired by natural photosynthesis, which harnesses solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water to the value-added products needed to sustain life; however, the chemical end products are limited to biomass, a complex mixture required to make the plant's food and body. We are developing a hybrid inorganic-biological approach that can go beyond natural photosynthesis by creating cyborg cells that are capable of synthesizing a specific complex chemical product from carbon dioxide and water with sustainable solar and/or electrical input, spanning fuels, foods, medicines, and materials. In the longer term, this materials biology platform has the potential to endow photosynthetic capabilities to any living cell or organism. Biography Professor; B.S./M.S.

She has extensive experience in working with major global and U.S. organizations and agencies involved in HIV research and policy. Efforts led by Miller to advance public health policy through stakeholder engagement include the National Summit program, which focuses on the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the Viral Hepatitis Action Plan; and the Bay Area Health Disparities Program. As a senior researcher and lecturer, Miller teaches a graduate-level course she developed on FDA and drug development, based on case studies from the Forum’s rich history in facilitating drug development. She mentors interns and fellows pursuing regulatory, biotech, and translational medicine careers. She joined the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research in 2001 after having directed the interdisciplinary HIV Research Group at the HIV Outpatient Clinic of the JW Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Together with Joep Lange, she co-founded and chaired the Euro-Guidelines Group on HIV Drug Resistance, the first pan-European group established for the purpose of assuring a common standard-of-care for patients in all European states. Miller has served on numerous industry and government advisory boards. She has published over 90 peer-reviewed publications on HIV treatment strategies and regulatory strategies for HIV and HCV. Research Interests: Advancing regulatory science for unmet medical/public health needs Collaborative frameworks for drug development Translating biomedical innovation to global access Disease areas: HIV, HCV, HBV, CMV, liver diseases Research Description: In 2001, Miller joined the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research—a public/private partnership addressing cutting-edge science and policy issues through a process of stakeholder engagement and deliberation—as executive director. The Forum brings together researchers and advocates, national and international regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, health care providers, and private foundations to compare data and debate consequences. The Forum also identifies gaps and impediments, frames issues, and helps set research strategy. Under her leadership, the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research has extended its deliberative process to advance regulatory science (applied successfully to HIV) to drug development for hepatitis C infection, the treatment of liver diseases (NASH and fibrosis), and human cytomegalovirus disease in solid organ and stem cell transplant patients. Prior to 2001, Miller’s own research focused on randomized clinical trials and observational cohorts to determine factors associated with HIV treatment outcomes, including the impact of drug resistance, documented in more than 50 peer-reviewed articles.

       " 'Laura J. Enriquez': 'Professor Research Interests: Development in Latin America; Latin American Emigration to Europe; Rural Sociology, Political Sociology; Social Movements Office: 432 Barrows Phone: 510-642-2502 Curriculum Vitae: cvLAURA (2).pdf Profile: Laura Enríquez’ principal interest lies in the possibilities and dilemmas inherent in social transformation in Latin America. She has approached this interest through the lens of agriculture, whether in the shape of agrarian reform, food policy, or more general policies related to production in this sector of the economy and those who engage in it. More recently, her sociological lens has broadened to explore how the lack of such change has led to migration from the region to Europe. Her research sites have been Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela, and Italy, where she has engaged in interviewing and ethnography to study these topics. Enríquez’ first two books were broadly concerned with the impact of the agrarian reform that was carried out in Nicaragua under the Sandinista government between 1979 and 1990. She looked at the effect it had on the economy as a whole, as well as the ways in which it influenced the political perspective of agrarian reform beneficiaries. In addition, she examined the shift in food policy in post-1990 Cuba, and the country\\'s larger process of agrarian transformation, as its socialist government attempted to survive the collapse of its key trade partner - the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Enríquez’ most recent book, Reactions to the Market: Small Farmers in the Economic Reshaping of Nicaragua, Cuba, Russia and China, brings her research on the first two of these countries together in an analysis of the different strategies that each government pursued in the post-1990 period to address their economic crises, and the impact these had on small farmers. Placing Nicaragua\\'s and Cuba\\'s small farmers in a comparative light with those of Russia and China, it argues that reform strategies implemented in each case reflected the overall political economic orientation of their respective governments: in Nicaragua and Russia, the emphasis was on bringing about a rapid retreat from socialism, and in Cuba and China (especially between 1978-1985), it was on reconfiguring socialism. The book situates this discussion at the intersection of the theoretical debates concerning \"the transition to the market\" that has taken place in former socialist countries - in particular the issue of whether that transition has led to more or less inequality - and the future of the peasantry with the expansion of capitalism in agriculture. Trends in Latin American politics starting in the late 1990s opened the way for another project undertaken by Enríquez, which explores the opportunities and challenges inherent in following the electoral path toward socialism. Her country of study has been Venezuela, where she has focused on the state and its implementation of agrarian reform, as well as its effort to transform agricultural production toward the achievement of food sovereignty. Enríquez’ most recently initiated project explores what happens when Latin Americans – most especially women – find themselves unable to improve their own and their family’s prospects in their home country. Aside from migrating within the region and northward to the U.S., a growing number of Latin Americans are migrating to Europe. Italy and Spain are the principal receiving countries there. This project examines the conditions that have led them to leave their home countries, how they are received when they arrive in Italy, and their on-going relationship with Latin America during their sojourn in Europe.

       " 'Donald P. Weston': \"Adjunct Professor Email: dweston@berkeley.edu Phone: Full Contact Information > Research Description I am an ecologist and ecotoxicologist with interests in the impact of human activities, particularly the release of toxic substances, on organisms at the individual, population, and community levels. I am most interested in applying basic ecological insights (e.g., feeding and digestive strategies, animal/substrate interactions) to toxicology in order to provide greater environmental realism to questions of pollutant uptake and toxicity. Most of my research falls within the general areas of pollutant bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and toxicity, and the extension of these principles to assessment of ecological risk posed by contaminated aquatic sediments. The current research in my laboratory is focused on the environmental toxicology of pesticides, and particularly those that are sediment-associated. Prominent among these are the pyrethroids, a class of insecticides widely used in both agricultural and urban environments. Our studies have shown the compounds to commonly be found in agricultural and urban waterways, and frequently present at concentrations acutely toxic to sensitive invertebrates. My lab is currently developing several new techniques to determine what substances may be responsible for toxicity when observed, including tools to help identify when pyrethroids are playing a role in this toxicity. We are quantifying pyrethroid input to surface waters from urban storm drains, and studying the seasonality and mechanism of transport. Finally, we are evaluating several approaches for mitigating off-site transport of sediment-bound pesticides from agricultural lands, such as the use of polyacrylamide to control erosion. Another area of my recent research is the development of a procedure to better quantify the bioavailable contaminant in sediment by extraction of the sediment using the digestive fluid of deposit-feeding invertebrates. Solubilization by this fluid, rather than an exotic chemical as would be used in a conventional extraction, has greater ecological relevance and provides a better basis for environmental management decisions. Other past projects in my laboratory include evaluation of dredging as a remedial alternative for a DDT-contaminated marine system, and the environmental effects of aquaculture operations on benthic communities.

Emotion individual differences in emotional expression, gender and emotion, the relationship between social context, personality, and emotion. whatshot Research Description Ann M. Kring's broad interests are in emotion and psychopathology. Specific interests include the emotional features of schizophrenia, assessing negative symptoms in schizophrenia, and the linkage between cognition and emotion in schizophrenia. In addition, Dr. Kring studies emotion in healthy individuals, with a focus on individual differences in expressive behavior, gender differences in emotion, and the linkages between cognition, personality, social context, and emotion. Dr. Kring and her research group have been studying the nature of emotion disturbance in schizophrenia, observing a couple of emotional disconnections in this population. First, people with schizophrenia show less observable facial expression despite reporting equally intense amounts of experienced emotion compared to people without schizophrenia. Second, people with schizophrenia score higher than people without schizophrenia on clinical measures of anhedonia, indicating a reduction in the experience of pleasure, yet they report experiencing comparable amounts of pleasant emotions in daily life and in the presence of pleasant stimuli. A primary focus of her research program has been to uncover the mechanisms driving these emotion disconnections in schizophrenia. Ongoing studies are designed to assess the nature of anhedonia in schizophrenia, examining anticipatory pleasure (i.e., pleasure in anticipation of future events as well as the ability to predict whether future events will be pleasurable), consummatory pleasure (i.e., pleasure in the moment), and memory for pleasurable events. Other studies are examining emotional responding among women with schizophrenia, an area that has not been well investigated. Drawing upon this basic work on emotion in schizophrenia, Dr. Kring worked collaboratively with three other investigators (Dr. Jack Blanchard at University of Maryland; Dr. Raquel Gur at University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Bill Horan at UCLA) to validate a newly developed clinical rating scale for negative symptoms. The Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS) was completed in 2013. An additional focus has been on the ways in which emotion can facilitate different types of cognitive processing in schizophrenia, such as attention and working memory, as well as the ways in which these cognitive processes can facilitate emotional processing. Current work in collaboration with investigators at UC Davis and funded by NIMH is examining the neural underpinnings of the maintenance of emotional responses in schizophrenia using fMRI and how maintenance deficits may be connected to deficits in cognitive control. Dr. Kring's research also focuses on the origins and consequences of individual differences in emotional expressivity. Ongoing studies seek to answer questions, such as whether anticipating a future emotional event provokes an immediate emotional response, whether the brain responds similarly to the anticipation of social versus monetary reward, how we make decisions in the face of mismatches between behavior and emotional expressions, and how our memory of past emotional events influences our ability to forecast or predict our future emotional responses. place Selected Publications Painter, J.

       " 'Omar M. Yaghi': \"The James and Neeltje Tretter Professor of Chemistry email: yaghi@berkeley.edu office: 602 Latimer Hall phone: 510-643-5507 lab: 636 Latimer Hall lab phone: 510- 643-3591 Research Group URL Research Description We are developing the science of building chemical structures from molecular building blocks; a field we refer to as Reticular Chemistry. It is concerned with linking of molecular building blocks (organic molecules, inorganic clusters, dendrimers, peptides, proteins,...) into predetermined structures in which such units are repeated and are held together by strong bonds . This research has led to the discovery of several classes of porous crystalline materials: metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (MOFs, COFs, and ZIFs). In practice, this kind of chemistry requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving inorganic synthesis of metal complexes and frameworks, organic synthesis of the linkers and synthetic modification of frameworks' interior, solid-state and solution synthesis, and the characterization techniques associated with these diverse areas ranging from electron microscopy, NMR, X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction to gas adsorption isotherm measurements. We design open frameworks to have ultrahigh porosity (up to 6,000-10,000 meter square per gram) exceeding traditional porous materials such as zeolites, mesoporous silica and carbon; making MOFs, COFs and ZIFs useful for clean energy storage and generation. Presently, we are able to design the structure of the frameworks, their functionality, and the pore environment and metrics to produce crystalline materials capable of storage and separation of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, water, volatile organics, peptides and proteins. The ability to functionalize the interior of the pores also results in enzyme-like active sites installed within the confines of such MOF structures for their use in catalysis of reactions leading to clean energy generation: conversion of methane to methanol, water to hydrogen and oxygen, organic cyclization reactions, and carbon-carbon bond breaking reactions. We have also made progress in transferring this precise control in building frameworks to the design of nano-MOFs and the development of their use as supercapacitors, proton and electron conductive materials. We continue to extend this chemistry to new frameworks and nanocrystals in which the pores are decorated by multiple functionalities arranged and apportioned in unique sequences throughout the material. We believe these regions and sequences code for specific properties in a way that is not too dissimilar from sequences of nucleotides in DNA and amino acids in proteins. Thus our work is aimed at making MOF, COF and ZIF materials capable of (a) counting and sorting molecules, (b) having compartments which are linked yet function synergistically, (c) carrying out multiple catalytic transformations in precisely controlled molecular space, and (d) exhibiting hybrid properties of molecular recognition, signal transduction and mechanical action. Recently, we have used coordination chemistry to bring together organic threads in a weaving manner. Once the structure is formed, it can be demetalated leaving behind a thoroughly woven organic ‘cloth’ for which the elastic properties are dramatically different than those of the metalaled forms. Molecularly woven chemical structures of this kind provide means of accessing frameworks that combine dynamics with resiliency. The principles of this new science are being extended to polymers and nanocrystals. Brief Biography Omar M. Yaghi received his B.S. degree from State University of New York-Albany (1985), and Ph.D. from the University of Illinois-Urbana (1990) with Professor Walter G. Klemperer. He was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University (1990-92) with Professor Richard H. Holm. He has been on the faculties of Arizona State University (1992-98), University of Michigan (1999-2006), and UCLA (2007-2011). He is currently the James and Neeltje Tretter Chair Professor of Chemistry at UC Berkeley, and a Senior Faculty Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He is the Founding Director of the Berkeley Global Science Institute. He is also the Co-Director of the Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute, and the California Research Alliance by BASF. His early accomplishments in the design and synthesis of new materials have been honored by the Solid-State Chemistry Award of the American Chemical Society and Exxon Co. (1998) and the Sacconi Medal of the Italian Chemical Society (2004). His work on hydrogen storage was recognized by Popular Science Magazine which listed him among the 'Brilliant 10' scientists and engineers in USA (2006), and the US Department of Energy Hydrogen Program Award for outstanding contributions to hydrogen storage (2007). He was the sole recipient of the Materials Research Society Medal for pioneering work in the theory, design, synthesis and applications of metal-organic frameworks and the AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize for the best paper published in Science (2007). He is also the recipient of the American Chemical Society Chemistry of Materials Award (2009), Izatt-Christensen International Award (2009), United Kingdom's Royal Society of Chemistry Centenary Prize (2010), China Nano Award (2013), King Faisal International Prize in Science (2015), and Mustafa Prize in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (2015). His work encompasses the synthesis, structure and properties of inorganic and organic compounds and the design and construction of new crystalline materials. He is widely known for inventing several extensive classes of new materials termed metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. These materials have the highest surface areas known to date, making them useful in clean energy storage and generation. Specifically, applications of his materials are found in the storage and separation of hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide, and in clean water production and delivery, supercapacitor devices, proton and electron conductive systems. The building block approach he developed has led to an explosive growth in the creation of new materials having a diversity and multiplicity previously unknown in chemistry. He termed this field 'Reticular Chemistry' and defines it as 'stitching molecular building blocks into extended structures by strong bonds'. He published over 200 articles, which have received an average of over 300 citations per paper. He is among the top five most highly cited chemists worldwide.\",\n",

He is a pioneer in the emerging field of ‘Exposure Biology’ and a prominent advocate of the concept of the ‘Exposome’ as a new paradigm for environmental health. Much of his current research involves the development and application of blood protein adducts as biomarkers of exposure to toxic chemicals arising from inhalation, ingestion, and endogenous processes. This has led to the concept of the protein adductome, representing signatures of people’s exposures to toxic chemicals. By comparing adductomes across populations, Prof. Rappaport hopes to identify important biomarkers of chronic diseases. He has also used environmental measurements and biomarkers to elucidate the human metabolism of several toxic chemicals, notably benzene, and to quantify interindividual variability in biomarker levels due to genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Prof. Rappaport has also published extensively in areas related to the assessment of long-term chemical exposures for purposes of controlling hazards and of investigating exposure-response relationships. He has more than 200 peer-reviewed publications and has collaborated extensively with investigators throughout the world. Selected Publications: S.M. Rappaport , H. Li, H. Grigoryan, W.E.

Research Professor Deacon's research has combined human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human cognition. His work extends from laboratory-based cellular-molecular neurobiology to the study of semiotic processes underlying animal and human communication, especially language. Many of these interests are explored in his 1997 book, The Symbolic Species: The Coevolution of Language and the Brain . His neurobiological research is focused on determining the nature of the human divergence from typical primate brain anatomy, the cellular-molecular mechanisms producing this difference, and the correlations between these anatomical differences and special human cognitive abilities, particularly language. In pursuit of these questions he has used a variety of laboratory approaches including the tracing of axonal connections, quantitative analysis of regions of different species brains, and cross-species fetal neural transplantation. The goal is to identify elements of the developmental genetic mechanisms that distinguish human brains from other ape brains, to aid the study of the cognitive consequences of human brain evolution. His theoretical interests include the study of evolution-like processes at many levels, including their role in embryonic development, neural signal processing, language change, and social processes, and how these different processes interact and depend on each other. Currently, his theoretical interests have focused on the problem of explaining emergent phenomena, such as characterize such apparently unprecedented transitions as the origin of life, the evolution of language, and the generation of conscious experience by brains. This is fueled by a career-long interest in the ideas of the late 19th-century American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce and his theory of semiosis. His new book, Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter , explores the relationship between thermodynamic, self-organizing, evolutionary and semiotic processes and provides a new technical conception of information that explains both its representational and normative properties.

I am interested in the question of power and space. My first book, Making Captialism in China: The Taiwan Connection , focuses on the role of culture in inter-regional capital flows. In my second book, The Great Urban Tansformation: Politics of Land and Property in China , I examine the issue of territorality. I look at how the transformation of the state and the society shapes and is shaped by land battles in Chinese cities and villages. My co-edited book, Reclaiming Chinese Society , looks at China’s emerging social activism in the struggles over distribution, recognition, and representation. My current project concerns the cultural and environmental politics in Northwestern China. For my research I draw inspiration from ethnographical work: in-depth interviews and participatory observation with a reflexive perspective. I believe that theorizing starts from muddy realities. It is a process of open dialogues and self-reflections, of which the historical and the geographical, the institutional and the emotional are all indispensable parts. Selected publications 2010.

       " 'Judith Klinman': 'Judith Klinman Contact Info Professor Emerita of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology Full Directory Information Research Interests The overall focus of our research is the determination of fundamental principles of catalytic and regulatory mechanism in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Our experimental approach is broadly based and combines kinetic, spectroscopic, stereochemical, and molecular biological techniques. Current Projects Protein and peptide- derived cofactors. Work over the last decade has forced us to expand our definition of enzymatic cofactors to include structures that are derived from the protein side chains themselves. Early studies by others had implicated simple radicals (e.g., the tyrosyl and glycyl radicals), whereas more recent work, (including much from this laboratory) indicates complex structures that require novel chemical pathways. We are currently focused on four distinct structures that are derived from protein- or peptide-bound tyrosine side chains: the 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanyl quinone (TPQ) found in the ubiquitous copper amine oxidases, the lysine tyrosyl quinone (LTQ) found in the mammalian lysyl oxidases, the cysteine tyrosyl radical (CTR) in the fungal galactose oxidase, and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), an essential vitamin for certain bacteria. Studies of the biogenesis of each of these structures require the expression of a precursor protein (or peptide in the case of PQQ), together with the establishment of conditions for monitoring the biogenetic processes. In the case of TPQ, LTQ and CTR all evidence indicates that these are produced by self-processing pathways that occur in the absence of exogenous protein factors, whereas PQQ requires six gene products. Both TPQ and LTQ were discovered in this laboratory and studies on the formation of TPQ are the most advanced, offering valuable protocols for studies of the other systems. In many instances, site specific mutagenesis has proven invaluable, leading to an accumulation of biogenesis intermediates that can be characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques. With regard to the function of these intriguing cofactors, recent studies of the mammalian TPQ-containing copper amine oxidases (found on the outer surface of the endothelium and adipocyte) suggest a role for enzymatically-produced hydrogen peroxide in cell signaling. Many experiments are either in progress or planned, to probe these provocative preliminary findings. Copper- and iron-containing monooxygenases . A very large number of key biological functions involve the use of molecular oxygen. For example, dopamine beta-monooxygenase catalyzes the formation of the hormone/neurotransmitter norepinephrine from dopamine. The enzyme is compartmentalized to either chromaffin vesicles in the adrenal gland or synaptic vesicles in the sympathetic nervous system. In contrast to amine oxidases, dopamine beta-monooxyegnase contains only copper as a cofactor. Key mechanistic questions concern the role of copper in oxygen/substrate activation and the nature of reactive oxygen intermediates. We have developed a set of protocols to study O 2 activation which includes distinguishing between O-16 and O-18 reactivity. We are now applying our unique methodology to a range of O 2 -dependent enzymes, which include dopamine beta-monooxygenase, lipoxygenase (an iron protein), peptide amidation enzyme (a copper protein), tyrosine hydroxylase (a pterin/iron system, catalyzing dopa formation from tyrosine), glucose oxidase (a flavo-protein) and cytochrome P-450 (a heme/iron system). Patterns have begun to emerge regarding dioxygen reactivity. Our goal is to systematize biological systems with regard to their mechanism of dioxygen activation. Nuclear tunneling in enzyme reactions. Over the course of our investigations of enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions, a number of anomalies had arisen which are incompatible with classical views of catalysis. In particular, these anomalies have suggested that quantum mechanical events may play a significant role in hydrogen transfer events at enzyme active sites. During the last several years, we have expanded the database for proteins that use tunneling as part of their catalytic strategy. Virtually every system examined thus far has shown some evidence for tunneling with the amount of tunneling varying from moderate to extreme. The effect of alteration in both substrate and protein structure is under investigation, with the goal of understanding the effect of changes in protein motion and active site geometry on tunneling. We have many interesting and surprising results that include the findings (i) that single active site residue can control tunneling, and (ii) that thermophilic proteins utilize hydrogen tunneling even at the elevated temperatures of their optimal function.

Education M.L.A., University of Pennsylvania B.Arch., North Carolina State University Philosophy Statement The relationship between landscapes and structures fascinates me. In both my teaching and practice, I focus on landscapes where structural interventions -buildings, roads, walls, pavements, sculpture, bridges and other human made artifacts - are introduced into landscapes to create vivid landscape experiences. To better understand the dimensional scale of proposed landscape changes, students in my classes often experiment with full-scale construction and/or mock-ups of proposals and are encouraged to learn from built landscapes by measuring and accurately depicting these landscapes and their details in dimensioned drawings. Through visits to construction sites and manufacturers of construction materials I hope to instill in students a passion for how the knowledge of materials and the craft of construction can inspire and contribute to innovative design solutions. Biography Linda Jewell joined the faculty in 1991 after fifteen years of combining an active professional practice with academic appointments, including 4-1/2 years as Chair of Harvard’s Department of Landscape Architecture. Professor Jewell is a committed educator who has always kept a hand in practice. Her publications and design work have won numerous ASLA merit and honor awards, including the prestigious Presidential Award in Communications for her 10 years of Construction articles in Landscape Architecture Magazine (LAM) and the 2008 Jot Carpenter teaching Medal from the ASLA. The focus of her scholarship is in four areas: 1) the artistic role of landscape details and sustainable building materials in landscape design; 2) the relationship of landscapes and structures, particularly outdoor theaters 3) the interplay of drawings and on-site design decisions in the design of landmark landscapes and 4) the influence of published images and on-site experiences from other cultures on design practice. She has published more than 30 articles on landscape construction and design and has produced several exhibitions, including a traveling exhibition on American outdoor theaters that she is developing into a book. Professor Jewell is also a member of the Master of Urban Design faculty and teaches design studios, courses on sustainable construction materials, construction techniques, and the analysis of designed landscapes.

These materials are used to develop and study new chemical reactions and the reactive intermediates involved in these transformations, and to explore applications in homogeneous catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, organic synthesis and green chemistry. Professor Bergman and his coworkers utilize a range of chemical techniques to discover new chemical reactions, determine how those reactions work, and apply that understanding to their application in catalysis and organic synthesis. In catalytic reactions very small amounts of soluble organometallic complexes are used to transform much larger quantities of organic compounds--such as those found in living organisms, or in natural feedstock sources such as petroleum--into more complicated substances that might ultimately be useful in the synthesis of important chemical compounds. Professor Bergman's group has generated reactive organometallic intermediates capable of undergoing intermolecular oxidative addition with the normally inert C-H bonds in alkanes and other organic molecules. This process holds potential for converting alkanes into functionalized organic molecules such as alkenes and alcohols. Solution mechanistic studies, as well as flash kinetic experiments carried out in collaboration with the Moore and Harris groups, have identified alkane-metal complexes as intermediates in many of these reactions. In recent collaborations with the with the J. A. Ellman group at Yale University, C-H activating reactions have been used to develop new catalytic intra- and intermolecular carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, some of which are enantioselective. Another area of investigation involves the study of organometallic complexes having metal-oxygen, -and metal-nitrogen bonds to obtain information about the mechanisms of metal-mediated oxidation and amination processes. Some of the compounds prepared in these projects have been utilized in highly enantioselective asymmetric induction reactions, and others act as homogeneous catalysts for new carbon-hydrogen and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming processes such as hydroamination of alkynes, alkenes and allenes. A collaborative project with the Raymond group has identified highly selective organic and organometallic transformations that can be carried out in the sterically confined cavities of self-assembled nanovessels, in some cases with levels of rate acceleration that allow the encapsulated reactions to be performed catalytically. Finally, the group has initiated new studies aimed at converting highly functionalized compounds such as polyols into useful chemical feedstocks.

We study the nature of the communication signals used by humans (speech and music) and animals using behavioral and statistical approaches. We study the auditory system of humans and songbirds using neurophysiological techniques. We use computational methods to generate theories of audition, to study sounds and to analyze our neural data. Our working hypothesis is that the dimensions that define the auditory perceptual space (such as pitch, timbre and loudness) exist because they correspond to acoustical features that provide robust cues about the information present in the communication signal. We are attempting to prove this hypothesis by analyzing the statistics of natural sounds and by performing various behavioral studies in humans and animals. In parallel we are studying the computations performed by the auditory system that can extract the acoustical cues that correspond to these auditory percepts. Finally, we are interested in the role of experience in shaping our auditory perceptual abilities and on the development of our auditory system. These investigations have led us to study the nature of the speech signal, to examine the perceptual space of timbre, to study the vocal communication system in non-human animals, to record the activity of auditory neurons in songbirds and to examine auditory responses in the human brain using imaging techniques. Additional details and a synopsis of current results can be found on the lab website. place Selected Publications Mathevon, N., Koralek A, Weldele M, Glickman SE, Theunissen FE.

       " 'Raka Ray': 'Professor Research Interests: Gender, postcolonial sociology,  emerging middle classes, South Asia, inequality, qualitative research methods, social movements Office: 472 Barrows Phone: (510) 642-6081 Curriculum Vitae: rrvita2016.pdf Profile: I am a sociologist with interests in gender and feminist theory, postcolonial sociology and the emerging middle classes. My site of research is India. My interest in gender is fundamental to my work as a scholar, even as how I study gender has continually evolved. Here’s a brief description of my areas of work: Social Movements : My first book, Fields of Protest , argued that the differences in the women’s movements of two Indian cities (Kolkata and Mumbai) could be attributed to the shape of their political fields, and argued that the success or failure of politically affiliated and autonomous women’s groups depended on the political fields within which they were located. Social Movements in India (co-edited with Mary Katzenstein) shows the differences between social movements formed in the crucible of Nehruvian and post-Nehruvian India. Reproduction of Inequality : In Cultures of Servitude (co-authored with Seemin Qayum), we examined how class and gendered inequality gets produced and reproduced on a daily basis within the private world of the household. A co-edited book with Amita Baviskar, Elite and Everyman: The Cultural Politics of the Indian Middle Classes questions the expected link between the growth of the middle classes and democracy in the Indian context, suggesting that the cultural dominance of the middle class has effectively undermined and even subverted the democratic possibilities inherent in Indian politics. Postcolonial Sociology : Several essays explore the possibilities of a Postcolonial Sociology, both in terms of the substance of Postcolonial theory – a consideration of the constitutive effects of colonial rule on colonizer and colonized ‐‐and in terms of the challenges to the epistemological foundations of the field of Sociology. A special issue of Political Power and Social Theory (co-edited with Ann Orloff and Evren Savci) highlights how the absence of postcolonial reflexivity might lead to perverse gender politics. Gender, Class and Neoliberalism : My current project, set in the cities of Mumbai, Allahabad and Siliguri, investigates new meanings of middle-classness, gender and mobility against a neoliberal economy and the valorization of the culture of aspiration. Pedagogy : The Handbook of Gender showcases classic and contemporary approaches to the study of gender in India in fields ranging from law to politics and from sexuality to religion. The Social Life of Gender (forthcoming, Sage), co-written with former students (Particularly Jennifer Carlson and Abigail Andrews), is a new, global approach to teaching the Sociology of Gender in the US.

The first is how the unemployed find work, and what aspects of job search may help or hurt different unemployed people. The second is what labor market policies influence labor demand, which affects the number of unemployed who will be able to find work. The third is understanding the factors which push firms and workers into long run success or back into unemployment.

Kirp , is a policy consultant and former newspaper editor as well as an academic. In his seventeen books and scores of articles, in both the popular press and scholarly journals, he has tackled some of America’s biggest social problems, including affordable housing, access to health, gender discrimination and AIDS. Throughout his career, his main focus has been on education and children’s policy, from cradle to college and career. He was a member of the 2008 Presidential Transition Team, where he drafted a policy framework for early education. His latest book, Improbable Scholars: The Rebirth of a Great American School System and a Strategy for America\\'s Schools , was named outstanding book of 2013 by the American Education Research Association. The book chronicles how an urban school district has brought poor Latino immigrant children, many of them undocumented, into the education mainstream. His previous book, Kids First: Five Big Ideas for Transforming the Lives of Children , makes a powerful argument for building systems of support that reach from cradle to college and career. It won the National School Board Journal award for the best education book of 2011. The Sandbox Investment: The Preschool Movement and Kids-First Politics analyzes why early education has emerged as a national priority. It received the Association of American Publishers Award for Excellence. His account of the market-oriented drift of higher education, Shakespeare, Einstein, and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher Education garnered the Council for Advancement and Support of Higher Education’s research award.

This paper documents this achievement gap, then assesses a number of evidence-based strategies that hold promise of bridging that gap. Those strategies range from high-quality early education and skill-building reading programs to mentoring initiatives and interventions that address stereotype vulnerability. Much of the existing research has not isolated the effects on black males, and the paper offers new data that demonstrates those impacts. A sequence of interventions, which begin before kindergarten and continue during college, is recommended.

Abstract No school district can be all charismatic leaders and super-teachers. It can\\'t start from scratch, and it can\\'t fire all its teachers and principals when students do poorly. Great charter schools can only serve a tiny minority of students. Whether we like it or not, most of our youngsters will continue to be educated in mainstream public schools. The good news, as David L. Kirp reveals in Improbable Scholars, is that there\\'s a sensible way to rebuild public education and close the achievement gap for all students. Indeed, this is precisely what\\'s happening in a most unlikely place: Union City, New Jersey, a poor, crowded Latino community just across the Hudson from Manhattan. The school district--once one of the worst in the state--has ignored trendy reforms in favor of proven game-changers like quality early education, a word-soaked curriculum, and hands-on help for teachers. When beneficial new strategies have emerged, like using sophisticated data-crunching to generate pinpoint assessments to help individual students, they have been folded into the mix. The results demand that we take notice--from third grade through high school, Union City scores on the high-stakes state tests approximate the statewide average. In other words, these inner-city kids are achieving just as much as their suburban cousins in reading, writing, and math. What\\'s even more impressive, nearly ninety percent of high school students are earning their diplomas and sixty percent of them are going to college. Top students are winning national science awards and full rides at Ivy League universities. These schools are not just good places for poor kids. They are good places for kids, period. Improbable Scholars offers a playbook--not a prayer book--for reform that will dramatically change our approach to reviving public education.

       " 'Bernard Sadoulet': 'Research Area(s): Astrophysics Biography Bernard Sadoulet, a graduate of Ecole Polytechnique (1963) and a “Docteur ès sciences” of Paris-Orsay University (1971), is by training an elementary particle physicist. As such, he had the chance of participating in two prestigious experiments which led to Nobel Prizes: the Mark I experiment at SLAC which discovered the J/ψ, the τ lepton and the charm, and UA1 at CERN which discovered the intermediate vector bosons W and Z. In 1984 he decided to shift his efforts towards particle astrophysics and cosmology. In 1985 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and from 1989 to 2001 he was the Director of the Center for Particle Astrophysics, one of the 11 first-generation Science and Technology Centers of the National Science Foundation. He is currently Director of the UC system-wide Institute for Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (INPAC). Focusing on the Search for Dark Matter, his current activities involve three aspects: Development of advanced phonon-mediated detectors, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment at a deep site, and related phenomenological activities on various aspects of supersymmetric dark matter. He is an Elected Member of the National Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Research Interests I am first an instrumentalist, attempting to develop sophisticated detectors capable of answering some of the most fundamental scientific questions of the moment. This is how I designed the UA1 Central Detector, a critical element in the discovery of the W and the Z. In the last 10 years, my main effort has been to develop phonon mediated detectors working at milliKelvin temperatures. I believe such advanced detectors may be necessary for the detection of the weakly interacting massive particles that could form the ubiquitous dark matter in the universe. The dark matter problem is currently one of the most central puzzles of astrophysics and cosmology (together with the dark energy). There is a good chance, in my mind, that it can be solved in the coming decade by the complementary work of relatively small teams such as ours. More generally, I like to work at the borders between several scientific disciplines, currently cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter. I am fascinated both by the new perspectives offered by such a multidisciplinary activities, and by the current rapid experimental progress, fueled in part by the technology transfer between these fields. At the same time, I like to keep some involvement in the phenomenology motivating our effort, as I strongly object to the prevalent separation between theorists and experimentalists. I regularly collaborate with theoreticians to attempt to identify the generic aspects of the models we are trying to test. I also believe it is essential to better link such research activities to society. I thus strongly encourage members of my group to get engaged in outreach activities, whether it is sharing with the public at large our exciting quest, involvement in K–12 education, or collaboration with industry. Current Projects Search for Dark Matter. My current activities involve three aspects, each of which offers research opportunities for graduate students: Development of advanced phonon-mediated detectors. Our current effort is focused on development of sensors for out-of-equilibrium phonons, using superconducting films and tunnel junctions at milliKelvin temperatures. The CDMS II experiment at a deep site. Although it is currently the most sensitive search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could form the dark matter in the universe, the first stage of our Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS I) is now limited by the shallowness of our Stanford site. We are now engaged in the preparation of a deep site experiment, which will take place in Soudan, in northern Minnesota, and is now fully funded for six years. “First Dark” should occur in Winter 2002. Related phenomenological activities. Six years ago, I have collaborated with Griest, Kamionkowski and Jungman on various aspects of supersymmetric dark matter. Currently, one of my students, Vuk Mandic collaborates with students of H. Murayama on supersymmetry investigations. I am open to the possibility of co-advising a graduate student with a theorist colleague. Publications J. R. Primack, D. Seckel, and B. Sadoulet, “Detection of cosmic dark matter,” Ann. Rev. Nucl.

Current Projects How does our immune system know if a virus is lurking within an infected cell, or if a normal cell has turned cancerous or if an organ is transplanted from an unrelated donor? All these cells differ from our normal self, but the differences are often hidden deep within the cells’ DNA. To permit the immune system to detect these differences, our cells have evolved a remarkable mechanism, called the antigen processing and presentation pathway, that reveals intracellular contents on the surface. This otherwise hidden information is then used to elicit immunity to viruses or cancer. Virtually all intracellular proteins are fragmented into small peptides (p) that are chaperoned by MHC molecules to the cell surface (as ‘pMHC’, see figure). This comprehensive pMHC display includes peptides derived from normal as well as new proteins, for example, a viral protein in an infected cell or a mutant protein in a cancer cell. The killer T cells of the immune system use their antigen receptors to recognize specific pMHC on the surface of target cells. The pMHC thus acts as a flag for activating killer T cells which eventually eliminate the undesirable ‘foreign’ cell. Unfortunately, the same mechanisms can also reject transplanted organs and self-tissues in autoimmunity. The unique antigenic peptides that set off the killer T cells and the mechanisms that generate the pMHC in health and disease are poorly understood. To identify unknown T cell activating peptides, we developed the ‘lacZ’ assay for measuring pMHC-specific T cell activation. T-cells containing the inducible β-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene are exquisite probes for detecting even rare pMHC producing cells. Because the pMHC are generated when the antigenic precursor protein is expressed in cells, we can screen DNA libraries with the lacZ T cell assay to isolate the relevant antigen coding gene. This expression cloning method has revealed the identity of many antigens from pathogenic microbes, parasites, transplanted tissues and cancer cells. Intriguingly, we also discovered that antigenic peptides are encoded not only in conventional ‘open’ but also in ‘non-coding’ cryptic translational reading frames. Such cryptic peptides are generated by a novel translation initiation mechanism and play key roles in immunity as well as normal cell biology such as the integrated stress response. We are currently studying the novel sources and translation initiation mechanisms that generate these unique peptides and their unique immunological and biological functions. We analyze the pMHC presentation pathway using cellular, genetic and biochemical methods for tracking naturally processed peptides in antigen presenting cells. By manipulating the expression of the antigen, molecular chaperones and proteases we have defined novel steps in the pMHC antigen presentation pathway. Remarkably, manipulating the intermediate antigen processing steps inhibit or enhance immunogenicity suggesting new approaches to vaccine design, microbial immunity and autoimmunity. We are currently studying how manipulations of the antigen presentation pathway impact immune responses towards viruses, microbes, cancer and self-tissues.

Isakson Prize, 1998; Dept. of Energy Award for Outstanding Scientific Accomplishments in Solid State Physics, 1983, for Sustained Outstanding Research in Solid State Physics, 1987 and for Significant Implications for DOE-Related Technologies, 1997. Research Interests Our research is in the broad area of interaction of light with matter comprising condensed matter physics, molecular physics, nonlinear optics, laser spectroscopy, and surface sciences. In particular, we have been active in search for understanding of nonlinear optical effects, developing novel linear and nonlinear optical techniques for material studies, and applying them to material science research. We initiated the field of nonlinear optics in liquid crystals and applications of nonlinear optics to characterization of liquid crystals. We pioneered the development of optical second harmonic generation and sum-frequency generation as powerful and versatile spectroscopic tools for surface and interface studies [See description in Y. R. Shen, Nature337, 519 (1989).] and their applications to many neglected, but important, areas of surface science. More recently, we have been developing optical sum-frequency generation as a novel sensitive spectroscopic technique for probing molecular chirality and for chiral microscopy. We are also engaging in optical characterization of nanostructures and studies of plasmonics and metamaterials. Current Projects Our current interest in surface and interfacial studies using SFG focuses on polymer surfaces and how they induce alignment of a liquid crystal film, which is of key importance in liquid crystal industry. Considering that SFG is the only technique that can yield vibrational spectra of liquid surfaces, we are also using the spectroscopic technique to probe the structures of various water interfaces at the molecular level and molecular adsorbates at such interfaces as well as ultrafast surface dynamics. These studies are highly relevant to many crucial problems in physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental science. We collaborate with Dr. Glenn Waychunas at LBNL studying water/oxide interfaces of importance to geoscience. For solid surfaces, we employ the technique to study surface melting of ice and surface phonons of oxides, problems that have hardly been explored. We have recently demonstrated that SFG can be used as chiral vibrational and electronic spectroscopy similar to the conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy, but with much higher sensitivity. We have obtained chiral vibrational and electronic SFG spectra from a molecular monolayer, which would be impossible to obtain with circular dichroism spectroscopy. We are now working on further improvement of the sensitivity of the technique and on possibility of carrying out chiral microscopy on biological systems in collaboration with Prof. Haw Yang¡¯s group in chemistry. Further work will include photo-induced chirality changes and chiral dynamics. In collaboration with Prof. Xiang Zhang’s group and researchers at Hewlett-Packard, we are studying metamaterials that exhibit negativce refractive index in the near-infrared range. Light propagation in such a medium is predicted to have many interesting behaviors including imaging not restricted by diffraction limit, optical switching of power links, backward harmonic generation, etc. worth investigating. Electromagnetic waves associated with metals, i.e., plamonics, are at the heart of metamaterials. This topic is also an interest of our study. We are also interested in optical characterization of nanostructures. Dr. Feng Wang in our group has developed different techniques, Rayleigh scattering, Raman scattering, two-photon-excited fluorescence, and modulated absorption spectroscopy to investigate electronic and phonon properties of single carbon nanotubes. The measurements will be extended to doped nanotubes, interaction between nanotubes, nonlinear responses and dynamics of nanotubes. Publications Y. R.

       " 'Stephen A. Small': \"Associate Professor Stephen Small has taught in the Department of African American Studies since 1994. He received his B.A. (honours) in Economics and Sociology from the University of Kent at Canterbury, his MS.C in Social Sciences, from the University of Bristol (both in the UK), and his Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Berkeley. He taught in the Department of Sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (1988-1992); in the Center for Research in Ethnic Relations at the University of Warwick (1991); and in the Department of Sociology at the University of Leicester (1992-1995). He was Study Center Director of the University of California's Education Abroad Program in France (Bordeaux and Toulouse), 2002-2004; and he was Director of UC, Berkeley's travel study program in Brazil (Salvador and Rio de Janeiro) from 2001-2005. The bulk of his teaching is about African Americans in the post Civil Rights period, but he necessarily makes comparisons with earlier periods, and with other racial and ethnic groups in the contemporary period. He frequently finds it useful to analyze the structure and institutional circumstances of African Americans, by making systematic reference to the circumstances of Blacks elsewhere in the Diaspora - especially in the Caribbean, Europe and in South America (especially Brazil). His undergraduate courses include Race, Class and Gender in African American Communities, Black Families in the USA, Globalization and Minority American Communities, and Theories of Race and Ethnicity. He also teaches Qualitative Research Methods for African American Studies. Graduate courses include Inter-Disciplinary Research Methods, Theories of Race and Ethnic Relations and Comparative International Race and Ethnic Relations. Research: Stephen Small's research is organized around the social scientific analysis of contemporary racial formations, and addresses links between historical structures and contemporary manifestations of racial formations in the United States and elsewhere in the African Diaspora. The two disciplines upon which he draws most heavily are Sociology and History. He has three active programs of research. The first is on race and representations in public history and collective memory, in which he explores how colonialism, slavery and their legacies are represented and interpreted in museums, memorials and monuments in the 21st century. He has undertaken research in the US South, England, the Netherlands and Brazil.  His ongoing field research in the US South concerns the distribution, role and treatment of the several hundred slave cabins that constitute part of the tourist infrastructure of the New South in the 21st century.  He has recently completed a book manuscript tentatively entitled â€˜Inside the Shadows of the Big House: 21st century antebellum slave cabins and heritage tourism in Louisianaâ€™.  He is conducting research for a second book on the unique and distinctive nature of slave cabins in heritage tourism across Louisiana as a whole.  And he is co-writing a book (with Dr. Kwame Nimako) on Public History, Museums and Slavery in England and the Netherlands. The second is on racial formations in Europe and the United States, which explores migration, institutional inequality and discrimination, community organization and community resistance, both within individual nations, as well as patterns across these nations. The third area is race and race mixture (so-called 'miscegenation') in the United States and the Caribbean under slavery, and in the contemporary United States. He explores institutional experiences, material resources and ideological articulations of race mixture at different historical moments. He is co-editor of a forthcoming book entitled Global Mixed Race, with Rebecca Chioko King Oâ€™Riain, Minelle Mahtani, Miri Song and Paul Spickard (forthcoming, New York University Press, 2014).

       " 'Steven Boggs': 'Research Area(s): Astrophysics Nuclear Physics Biography Steve Boggs received his B.S. in Physics, summa cum laude, from the University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign in 1991. He received his Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1998, where he held a NASA graduate student research fellowship. He was a Millikan Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology before returning to join the UC Berkeley Physics Department in July 2000. Professor Boggs became Chair of the department in July of 2013. Research Interests Experimental high energy astrophysics is the study of some of nature\\'s most exotic creations, and their application to exploring fundamental physics. My research is focused on developing and flying new gamma-ray telescopes to probe these environments from space. My primary interest is the detailed measurement of radioactive nuclei produced in the inner regions of a supernova explosion. Through their conversion of gravitational energy to nuclear energy, supernovae are the dominant engines of evolution in the Universe – controlling the production of the elements making up the world around us, the internal structure of galaxies, and the acceleration of cosmic rays. The radioactive nuclei produced in these explosions emit gamma-rays of characteristic energies for each isotope. These photons serve as sensitive probes of the detailed nuclear physics in the extreme conditions at the heart of a supernova, conditions far from the laboratory environment. These nuclei also allow us to discover and study the active sites of nucleosynthesis in our Galaxy. Gamma-ray astrophysics also touches many fields of fundamental physics, including the study of dark matter, quantum gravity, and cosmology, as well as studying matter in nature\\'s most exotic environments. We can\\'t see a black hole by definition, but high energy particles – accelerated by the deep gravitational well – emit gamma-rays before disappearing over the event horizon. These photons directly reflect the complex physics of particle interactions in highly-curved spacetime. Neutron stars are the ultimate balancing act between modern and classical physics, with the baryon degeneracy pressure precariously halting the collapse of the star to a black hole. The study of gamma-ray emission from the surface of these objects allows us to probe the nuclear equation of state in extremely general-relativistic conditions. A key to these studies is the development of gamma-ray instruments with excellent sensitivity. Our group is actively involved in scientific observations with several current telescopes, as well as the development of novel gamma-ray telescopes for satellite and balloon missions. Current Projects NCT: The Nuclear Compton Telescope is a balloon-borne soft gamma-ray (0.2-10 MeV) telescope designed to study astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and gamma-ray polarization. It employs a modern Compton telescope design, imaging gamma-rays through their scattering history in novel 3D tracking detectors. Implemented as a balloon payload, this telescope performs sensitive observations of positron annihilation, nuclear decays, black holes, neutron stars, GRBs, and AGN. NuSTAR: NuSTAR is the first focusing high energy X-ray satellite in orbit, providing more than two orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to previous high energy missions. NuSTAR primary science goals include conducting a survey of black holes; mapping young supernovae explosions; studying cosmic accelerators; and identifying high energy sources in our Galaxy.

       " 'Joseph Cerny': 'Professor of the Graduate School Professor Emeritus email: jcerny@berkeley.edu office: LBL 88 lab: LBL 88 phone: (510) 486-7852 fax: (510) 486-7983 Research Interests Nuclear Chemistry — Studies of nuclei very far from the stable isotopes may reveal highly unusual nuclear radioactivities. Studies are underway exploiting a new capability with radioactive nuclear beams. Research in the Cerny group centers on the study of the properties and decay schemes of exotic proton-rich nuclei and on the search for new modes of radioactive decay, such as two-proton radioactivity. Professor Cerny\\'s experimental program is concentrated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\\'s 88-Inch Cyclotron and utilizes its many high-energy beams of ions ranging from protons to uranium. Current research projects of the group involve high resolution determinations of decay schemes of beta-delayed proton and two-proton emitters; accurate mass measurements of nuclei far from stability; and spectroscopic studies involving the detection of unbound nuclei such as 2He as reaction products. The group also uses the Berkeley Gas-Filled Separator to search for new proton- or alpha-particle emitting isotopes in the region of the Chart of Nuclides near lead. Recently the Cerny Group has lead the effort to develop a radioactive ion-beam capability at the 88\" Cyclotron via the Berkeley Experiments with Accelerated Radioactive Species (BEARS) initiative. Short-lived radioactive isotopes are produced at the LBNL Biological Isotope Facility, transported as a gas through a 300 meter-long capillary to the 88\" Cyclotron, injected into the main ion source and accelerated as an ion beam. Upon completion of the BEARS activity-handling system in August 1999, this coupled-cyclotron facility produced 2x10 8 11C ions/sec on target for nuclear experiments. BEARS also provides beams of 7l second 14O and 122 second 15O. Studies in nuclear astrophysics and on nuclei far from stability have been conducted with this new capability.

Through a synthesis of phylogenetic, functional, and comparative morphological evidence, I try to assemble the best-supported evolutionary sequences available and to reconstruct the steps by which major adaptations, particularly vertebrate flight (pterosaurs, birds, and bats), arise. (2) The beginning of the \"Age of Dinosaurs.\" Although I work generally on Mesozoic vertebrate paleontology, I am most interested in the changes in the terrestrial vertebrate fauna that took place around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. (3) Systematics, functional morphology, and flight of pterosaurs. Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to gain powered flight, provide many interesting keys to the evolution of posture, locomotion, homeothemy, and vertebrate adaptation in the early Mesozoic Era. (4) Histology and constructional morphology of the bones of extinct reptiles. Comparative bone histology in a phylogenetic series of taxa and some ontogenetic series can provide the best picture of age, growth, and metabolism, and engineering design helps to understand functional adaptations of bone. Our histology work is in conjunction with other researchers in California, Montana, and France. (5) Species recognition, sexual selection, and related processes in living and extinct vertebrates. “Bizarre structures” in dinosaurs and other vertebrates often are assigned a “default” origin in sexual selection, but thus far they show no sexual dimorphism, which is a requirement for sexual selection (following Darwin). We investigate how species recognition, mate recognition, and other processes may have played roles in the evolution of these structures. We also have a long-standing and strong interest in public education, the representation of science, the history of science, and a strong representation of evolutionary science in curricula.

Research Rosemary Joyce\\'s research is concerned with questions about the ways people employ things in actively negotiating their place in society, the lives and itineraries of objects, and the reframing of human engagement with the world in terms of materiality. Her published writing includes books and articles on the use of representational imagery to create and reinforce gendered identities, ranging from examinations of Classic Maya monumental art and glyphic texts, to Formative period monumental and small-scale images. Some of this work also involves mortuary analysis. She is an expert in the study of ceramic materials, including studies of crafting, use of pots in everyday life and on special occasions, and meaning-making with painted pottery vessels and figurines. Rosemary Joyce participated in field research in northern Honduras from 1977 to 2009, in the Ulua and Cuyumapa valleys, Lake Yojoa, and the Caribbean coast. The sites where she conducted research date as early as before 1500 BCE to the Spanish colonial period. She employs multi-scalar approaches that consider regional patterns and detailed household archaeology together. Since 2010, she has been developing collaborations with colleagues in Mexico that bring the household scale approaches we developed in Honduras into a regional scale project in the hinterland of Classic Maya Palenque, in Chiapas. As a museum anthropologist, Joyce works with curated collections, including photographs and historical archives, in museums in North America, Europe, and Honduras. She has engaged in collections management and exhibition work at Harvard\\'s Peabody Museum, the Wellesley College Museum and Cultural Center, the Heritage Plantation at Sandwich, Massachusetts, the Museo de Antropología e Historia in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and the National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution. Her work with museum collections inspired an interest in disciplinary history. She has published work about women who were early archaeologists in Honduras, and more broadly on the history and sociopolitics of archaeology, using Honduras as a case study. This led to her current work on cultural policy and histories of collecting. Profile The questions I examine all arise from considering the way that things make people and people make things. Understanding materiality, I argue, requires attention to repetition over time, making historical anthropology and archaeology critical parts of understanding materiality as emergent and dynamic. My research in Honduras explored social histories in which economic inequality was never as extreme as among neighboring Maya societies, leading me to consider how archaeologists might combat the common assumption that ever-increasing inequality is somehow inevitable. Those concerns with inequality have been central as well to my explorations of difference, identification, and the exercise of power within societies as well, where I have been particularly attentive to intersectionality between gender, sexuality, and economic subordination. As a public anthropologist, I am equally concerned with the pragmatic ways that the kinds of things I study as historical sources are tied up in nationalism, cultural diplomacy (or \"soft power\"), and struggles about what constitutes cultural heritage and whose voices should count in determining what can and cannot be done with cultural properties. All of my interests are rooted in field practice in Honduras (and more recently, through collaborations, in Mexico) and museum research throughout Europe, North, and Central America.

Our research concerns the microscopic behavior of complex biological and material systems. Using the tools and concepts of statistical mechanics, we develop theories and simplified models for chemical phenomena in condensed phases, for biomolecular structure and dynamics, and for the role of fluctuations in nanoscale materials. We also use and devise techniques of modern computer simulation to investigate such systems on molecular length scales. We interact closely with experimental research groups both to inspire and to be inspired by state-of-the-art studies of real physical systems. Among our current interests is the elasticity of disordered networks of semiflexible polymers. Specifically, we are constructing models for the polymeric framework of living cells, which can exhibit dramatic dynamical restructuring. Explaining the microscopic origins of this sensitive response is an essential step in understanding mechanical aspects of cell signaling. A second interest is the dynamics of nanometer-sized solutes in a liquid undergoing phase change. We aim to determine how nonequilibrium fluctuations in such a system can be exploited to guide the spontaneous formation of useful patterned assemblies.

He has been a member of the department since 1996, and an affiliate of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory since 1992. His research interests are in the areas of seismic wave propagation, earthquake and non-earthquake seismic source processes, and in the development of methods for the reduction of earthquake losses and realtime earthquake monitoring. Use of waveform data to investigate seismic source, wave propagation, and Earth structure problems including geophysical inverse problems. Additionally, research is conducted to develop robust automated procedures to analyze earthquakes as they occur and to report strong shaking levels on a local and regional scale. Current research is focussed on nuclear event discrimination using regional distance moment tensors, investigating anomalous seismic radiation of Mammoth Lakes, CA, events, the development of a regional distance methodology to rapidly determine near-source strong ground motion shaking levels, and investigation of 3D crustal structure affects on ground motions in the greater San Francisco Bay area.

For example in a forest, trees fall, seeds grow, and forest fires burn. Microbial ecosystems experience similar fluctuations but on a much faster time scale. Taking advantage of the fast time scale and ease of setting up a controlled experiment, we study complex ecological dynamics that arise from microbial community interactions. Our research group investigates basic ecological principles in the context of the animal gut in order to understand the complicated and often complex relationship between microbiome and host. Current Projects Ecological complexity in a model microbiome. The fruit fly gut carries ~10 microbial species, all of which are culturable in the lab. To understand the gut ecological basis for host health, we measure the relationship between species diversity and ecological stabilty in relation to several parameters of fly health. In collaboration with Carolyn Elya and Mike Eisen (UC Berkeley), this project uses a defined microbial community in gnotobiotic fruit flies to investigate the connections between the fly's immunology and behavior and the microbial community's ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Phage-based enterotherapies. We are developing phage-based enterotherapies to drive ecological state change in the gut microbiome. Various parts of this work are in collaboration with Liam Holt, Kristopher Kennedy, and Richard Calendar (UC Berkeley). Collaborations: Role of the gut microbiota in canine autoimmune disease. The charismatic Norwegian Lundehund dog breed has severely limited genetic diversity and suffers from a highly prevalent (~40% of dogs) autoimmune disorder that causes gut and skin inflammation and may be linked to high neonatal mortality. In collaboration with Claudia Melis and Henrik Jensen at NTNU-Trondheim (Norway) and Carol Beuchat (UC Berkeley), we investigate the metagenomic (dog genome and microbial genomes) basis for this syndrome in the Lundehund. Role of microbiota in human mental health. Links between mental health and the gut microbiome have been documented in humans and mice. Paul Hamilton (Laureate Institute) uses fMRI imaging to map mental illnesses in the brains of patients before and after treatment. In collaboration with Paul's group, we are analyzing gut and mouth microbiomes in these patients before and after treatment to document concurrent changes in the patient microbiomes with the goal of identifying microbial genes that correlate with health and illness.

We currently have two main foci: Measurements from NASA U2 spyplanes and high altitude balloons, coupled with modeling and analysis, allow us to better quantify the sources and sinks of important direct or indirect greenhouse gases such as CO2, N2O, CH4, and H2 in today\\'s atmosphere. Laboratory experiments simulating the atmospheres of early Earth and Mars allow us to probe whether or not hydrocarbon (\"soot\") hazes may have provided an additional greenhouse effect or an \"antigreenhouse\" effect and thereby affected the surface temperatures and the stability of liquid water in the first 2 billion years of these planets\\' histories. The coupling of atmospheric chemistry and climate on Earth and other planets on time scales ranging from months to billions of years is studied through observations from aircraft and ground-based platforms, 2D and 3D computer simulations, and laboratory experiments. Of particular interest are studies of photochemical isotope effects on the molecular scale through crossed molecular beam laboratory experiments and up to the global scale through observations in Earth\\'s stratosphere.

Professor Miller\\'s research deals with essentially all aspects of chemical dynamics, especially the theory of chemical reactions and reaction rates, as well as other dynamical phenomena such as photodissociation, femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, etc. The goal is to be able to describe these dynamical processes at the same level of molecular detail as one can the static/structural properties of molecules. Effort is focused on developing new theoretical methods and models, and also on the application of these approaches to specific problems of chemical interest. For small (3 or 4 atom) molecular systems it is possible to carry out essentially exact quantum mechanical scattering calculations, and indeed a great deal of success has been achieved in recent years in calculating state-to-state reactive scattering cross sections. This provides the most complete characterization of a chemical reaction allowed by the basic laws of nature. Even more exciting, however, has been the development of ways to calculate more averaged properties of a chemical reaction, e.g., its thermally averaged rate constant, \"directly\" i.e., without inherent approximation. This is not only an interesting intellectual development, but it provides improved ways to carry out practical calculations of rate constants for chemical reactions. To treat more complex molecular systems Prof. Miller\\'s group is pursuing use of the semiclassical (SC) initial value representation (IVR) as an approximate way to include quantum effects into classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. CMD can be applied nowadays to a wide variety of complex molecular phenomena - chemical reactions in liquids, in clusters, in biomolecular environments, on surfaces - but it is based totally on classical mechanics to describe the motion of the nuclei. (Electrons, of course, are treated quantum mechanically and produce the effective potential function that governs nuclear motion.) Semiclassical theory is capable of describing all types of quantum effects - interference/coherence, tunneling, vibrational zero point energy, effects of identical particle symmetry - and the IVR is potentially a practical way of implementing SC theory for truly complex molecular systems. A variety of new advances have recently been made that significantly enhance the practicality of the SC-IVR approach, and calculations have been carried out for a number of chemical problems that demonstrate its wide applicability; these include vibrational tunneling splitting in van der Waals complexes, photodissociation of ozone, femtosecond photodetachment of I2-, molecular energy transfer, proton transfer in 7-azaindole dimers, electronically non-adiabatic processes, and flux correlation functions for chemical reactions.

Four families of peptides (corticotropin-releasing factors, neurotensins, dynorphin A and mystixins) were identified to possess anti-inflammatory properties. These peptides inhibit the vascular leakage that occurs after tissue injury. The potential therapeutic values of anti-inflammatory peptides are being evaluated in animal models and in human clinical trials. The development of agents that suppress inflammation may have value in understanding mechanisms of chemical toxicity. Current Projects: Recent activities are centered on finding novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of disseminated cancer. Specifically, he is looking at new anti-angiogenic agents, at melanocortin receptor antagonists, and at peptides of the corticotropin-releasing factor super family which suppress cell proliferation. He is also active in the assessment of environmental chemicals in water supplies and in evaluating their public health risk. Selected Publications: Publications Stuhr LE, Wei ET , Reed RK.

The developing sea urchin embryo generates four micromeres at its vegetal pole during the fourth cell division. These cells form primary mesenchyme, which in turn forms the endoskeletal spicule of the larva. We have developed methods to isolate and purify the spicules, and characterized the organic matrix of the spicules. It is composed of several glycoproteins. We have isolated cDNA clones from an expression vector library that encodes the principal (glyco)protein of the spicule matrix. We are studying the regulation of the expression of this and related genes and are trying to learn more about how the spicule is differentiated and constructed. Recent work utilizes fluorescent labeling and immunoelectron microscopy to follow the import, precipitation, and secretion of calcium and matrix proteins, which form the spicule. The calcium carbonate is precipitated in the cell as amorphous calcium carbonate, then undergoes exocytosis into a privileged extracellular space where it associates with matrix proteins and undergoes a gradual conversion to crystalline calcite. The molecular mechanisms and genes that undergird these processes are being studied. Selected Publications StartFragment The sea urchin ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) spicule proteome. [K.

Eggers, Jr. Chair in English B26 Hearst Annex Friday 12:30-2:30 and by appt. jknapp@berkeley.edu \\ufeff Professional Statement Jeffrey Knapp is the Eggers Professor of English at UC Berkeley. After undergraduate and then graduate study at Berkeley, he taught at Harvard for three years before returning to Berkeley in 1990. Knapp received the campus’s Distinguished Teaching Award in 2002; he is also the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and an NEH Fellowship. Knapp has written four books: An Empire Nowhere: England and America from Utopia to The Tempest (1992); Shakespeare’s Tribe: Church, Nation, and Theater in Renaissance England (2002), which won the Best Book in Literature and Language award from the Association of American Publishers, the Book of the Year award from the Conference on Christianity and Literature, and the Roland H. Bainton Prize for the Best Book in Literature from the Sixteenth Century Society and Conference; Shakespeare Only (2009), which Choice named an Outstanding Academic Title of the year; and Pleasing Everyone: Mass Entertainment in Renaissance London and Golden-Age Hollywood, published this year by Oxford University Press -- Knapp\\'s first book on film as well as literature and theater.

On the other side are the theater historians who view modern claims of Shakespeare’s uniqueness as a distortion of his real professional life.... Critical Theory Cultural Studies Drama Renaissance and Early Modern Shakespeare\\'s Tribe: Church, Nation, and Theater in Renaissance England Most contemporary critics characterize Shakespeare and his tribe of fellow playwrights and players as resolutely secular, interested in religion only as a matter of politics or as a rival source of popular entertainment. Yet as Jeffrey Knapp demonstrates in this radical new reading, a surprising number of writers throughout the English Renaissance, including Shakespeare himself, represented plays.... Cultural Studies Drama Renaissance and Early Modern An Empire Nowhere: England, America, and Literature from Utopia to The Tempest What caused England\\'s literary Renaissance? One answer has been that such unprecedented developments as the European discovery of America inspired English writers to \"open up new worlds for the imagination.\" Yet England in the sixteenth century was far from an expanding nation. Not only did the Tudors lose England\\'s sole remaining possessions on the Continent and, thanks to the Reformation, gr....

Principles of solid state physics provide a recipe for creating materials with low elastic moduli, G. For crystals, G=1/<x^2>d where <x^2> is the mean square displacement of the atoms, d is the lattice constant. In liquids, the mean square displacement is bounded only by the size of the container. Soft materials are thus characterized by periodic microstructures with relatively large lattice constants (d in the nanometer to micrometer range), fluctuations and disorder (the magnitude of <x^2> can approach d), and liquid crystalline symmetry. We specialize in studying soft microstructures that self-assemble from the liquid state. The self-assembled nature of the structures that we study has important consequences. These microstructures form spontaneously and do not require machining or microlithography, as is the case with conventional manufacturing. Also, the structure need not be permanently fixed; it can be altered by changing external conditions, like temperature, pressure or stress. Subtle changes in the external conditions could lead to profound changes in the mechanical, optical and electrical properties of the material if they are accompanied by a microstructural transition. These changes could be accomplished repeatedly and reversibly if the structures are at equilibrium. These materials thus have the potential of performing complex functions, if we can understand the physical origins of their complex responses and control them to produce useful results. My program is concerned with the synthesis of such materials and the quantification of thermodynamic interactions that lead to microstructure formation. We are also developing experimental tools and the theoretical framework necessary to characterize the soft materials. We also use these materials to obtain a fundamental understanding of processes such as nucleation and flow alignment Biography Professor; Faculty Associate Scientist, LBNL; Ph.D. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1988); National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award (1994); Sigma Xi Distinguished Faculty Research Award, Polytechnic University (1995); 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award, (1996); Engineer of the Year, American Institute of Engineers of Indian Origin (1997); John H.

       " 'Dmitry Budker (E)': 'Research Area(s): Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Biography Dmitry Budker received his Ph.D. in physics from UC Berkeley in 1993 and was a postdoctoral researcher at the University until his faculty appointment in 1995. Born in the former USSR, Budker was a student at the Novosibirsk State University from 1980 until 1985, when he received an equivalent to MS with honors from the Department of Physics. He then served as a junior researcher at the Institute of Nuclear Physics, where he conducted research on laser spectroscopy of atoms. In 1994, Budker received the American Physical Society Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award, a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and was a Miller Professor in 2003-2004. Research Interests Budker’s research interests are related to the study of violation of discrete symmetries – parity, time reversal invariance, and permutation symmetry for identical particles - using the methods of modern atomic physics. In particular, he has been involved in exploring the rare earth elements - samarium, dysprosium and ytterbium - where enhancement of P and P,T violating effects occurs due to close proximity of states with opposite nominal parity. More recently, he has also been involved in experimental search for temporal variation of fundamental “constants.” Such experiments involve many aspects and techniques of atomic physics, as well as of linear and nonlinear optics and spectroscopy. Some of the Budker group research involves experimental condensed-matter physics and nuclear magnetic resonance. Budker and his group are also studying applications of nonlinear optical phenomena in resonant vapors and in color centers in diamond to sensitive magnetometry. The group maintains a roughly 50-50 balance of fundamental-physics and applied projects. Current Projects The experiments currently being carried out include: Experimental searches for P-violating effects in ytterbium Ultimately, this work may lead to a precision comparison of PNC effects on different isotopic and hyperfine transitions Investigation of nonlinear optical rotation and its applications to sensitive magnetometry and fundamental physics Investigation of spin-relaxation properties of atoms in cryogenic buffer gas environment Experimental tests of Bose-Einstein quantum statistics for photons Development of all-optical magnetic sensors for field and space applications Nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic-resonance imaging with atomic magnetometers. Experimental search for a possible temporal variation of the fine-structure “constant” and measuring parity nonconservation using radio-frequency electric-dipole transitions in dysprosium Investigation of fundamental properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond and application of NV ensembles to sensitive magnetometry Atomic physics of and remote magnetometry with mesospheric-sodium laser guide stars Collaborators in this work include D. English, A. Pines (UCB Chemistry), S. K. Lamoreaux (Yale), M. Auzinsh (Latvia), W. Gawlik (Poland), D. F. Jackson Kimball (CSUEB), P. Hemmer (Texas A&M), S. Rochester (Rochester Scientific, LLC), A.

Hovde (Southwest Sciences, Inc.), A. Gordon (Israel), D. Bonaccini-Calia (ESO), R. Holzloehner (ESO), R. Folman (BGU, Israel), and many others. There are always several visitors and undergraduate students in the group. These experiments ideally suit the university environment since, in spite of their potential to produce results significant to our understanding of fundamental interactions, they are relatively small-scale; thus they can be carried out in a small research group and allow graduate and undergraduate students to actively participate in all aspects of the experiment - from planning and design and apparatus construction to data taking and analysis.

Dicke fellow from 1996 until 1998 and an assistant professor from 1998 until 2001 at Princeton University. He joined the UC Berkeley Physics faculty as an associate professor in 2002. Research Interests I am a string theorist and my research has focussed on various aspects of M-theory, F-theory, Matrix-models, Noncommutative geometry and the newly discovered six-dimensional theories and their large N limit. Over the past decade a lot of progress has been made in the study of strongly coupled supersymmetric field theories and string theories. The discovery of new field theories in six dimensions is one of the interesting recent developments. Their fundamental formulation is still mysterious but their existence was deduced from string theory. These theories are inherently strongly coupled quantum systems and they shed new light on nonperturbative and strong-coupling effects in gauge theories. Current Projects In our recent project we explored field theoretic models that exhibit nonlocal behavior. These models have emerged in the research on noncommutative field theories and their nonlocal behavior is related to macroscopic strings that become light under certain conditions. A better understanding of these models might shed more light on the microscopic structure of space and time. Publications O. J. Ganor, D. R. Morrison and N.

       " 'Sona Kang': 'Sona Kang Assistant Professor Research Description Why should we consider epigenetics in metabolic disorders? Complex metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes result from intricate interactions between internal genetic makeup and external environment, which is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. There are compelling reasons to think epigenetic control may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysregulation; 1) Genetic differences can not fully explain many etiological features of metabolic disorders, such as high heritability, high discordance of metabolic disorders in adult monozygotic twins, and the close relationship with lifestyle factors. Therefore, other forms of non-genetic variation, such as epigenetic alterations, should be considered in the etiology. 2) Drugs that affect chromatin remodeling, such as the HDAC inhibitors are known to affect insulin sensitivity in cells, animal models, and human subjects. 3) Collective studies report global and locus-specific epigenetic changes at key metabolic genes often accompanying reduced gene expression in association with various metabolic perturbations. 4) Most convincingly, studies have shown that several mouse genetic models carrying mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers display marked metabolic phenotypes. Despite these notions, the accurate role for the epigenetic modifiers in metabolic regulation largely remains unknown. Epigenomic profiling is a powerful discovery tool. Insulin resistance is a sine qua non of type 2 diabetes and is associated with many other clinical conditions including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. As an effort to identify novel transcriptional pathways of insulin resistance, we constructed global transcriptional and H3K27ac enhancer maps of insulin resistance using comparative models of insulin resistance induced by dexamethasone (Dex) or tumor necrosis factor-\\uf061 (TNF) in cultured adipocytes. As a result, we detected several locus-specific H3K27ac positive enhancers that display coordinate regulation nearby the co-induced genes by Dex and TNF. Motif analysis on these enhancer regions led us to discover transcriptional pathways insulin resistance, from which I demonstrated the biological significance of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) as common nodes for Dex and TNF mediated insulin resistance. Further, through integrative analysis of our epigenomic and transcriptomic data, we unraveled a core target genes of GR and VDR that can be used as molecular signature of insulin resistance. These studies illustrate the power of epigenomic profiling as a tool for the identification of novel pathogenic disease mechanisms. Our research mission Our research goal is to gain more accurate understanding of how epigenetic and transcriptional regulators control (patho)physiology of adipose and other metabolic tissues. Ultimately, we hope to identify novel drug targets for more safe and efficient therapeutic intervention to relevant metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes. The key questions that we address are; 1) What are the core epigenetic events underlying obesity and insulin resistance, especially in the fat tissue? 2) Does the adverse epigenetic have a direct contribution to the pathogenesis?, 3) If so, how does so?, and, 4) Can we fix the adverse epigenetic events to mitigate the condition? To answer these questions, we are uniquely geared to integrate a wide variety of approaches, from highly mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo, metabolic characterization of genetically modified mouse models, and to global profiling studies such ahs ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq.

       " 'Feng Wang': \"Research Area(s): Condensed Matter Physics And Materials Science Biography Feng Wang received a B.A. from Fudan University, Shanghai, in 1999 and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 2004. From 2005-2007, he has been a Miller Fellow with Miller Institute for Basic Science at Berkeley. He joined the physics faculty in fall, 2007. Research Interests We are interested in light-matter interaction in condensed matter physics, with an emphasis on novel physical phenomena emerging in nanoscale structures and at surfaces/interfaces. When electrons and phonons are confined in nanometer scale or at surface/interfaces, they respond differently to external stimuli. We investigate the unique nature and dynamics of such excited states using advanced laser spectroscopy techniques. Our laser spectroscopy has sensitivity down to individual nanostructures, together with time resolution of femtoseconds and spectral coverage extending from far-infrared, visible to UV. Current Projects Graphene optics : Graphene is a novel two dimensional material with extraordinary electrical and mechanical properties. It also has promising optical and optoelectronic properties: their low energy transitions can be continuously tuned by a gate voltage and fundamentally different behaviors are expected for single- and double- layered graphene. We are developing sensitive infrared spectroscopy using a microscopy setup with a femtosecond tunable light source. This will allow us to probe a wide range of graphene physics, from infrared electro-optic effect and graphene interlayer coupling to dynamics of electronic excitations and electron-phonon interactions. Optical spectroscopy of individual nanotubes : Carbon nanotubes are a rich family of one-dimensional structures. They can be either semiconducting or metallic and their properties depend sensitively on the exact nanotube structure. To elucidate their different behaviors, studies of individual nanotubes are needed. We have had extended experience on single nanotube spectroscopy. We are also developing nonlinear probes of individual nanotubes that have not been explored before. It will allow investigation of phenomena ranging from optical stark effect, Rabbi oscillation and coherent excitation in one-dimensional structure. Further, time resolved pump-probe measurements along individual nanotubes could yield direct information on carrier motion relevant to electrical and thermal transport. We are also collaborating with different groups in Berkeley to combine optical probe with mechanical, electrical, TEM and photo-emission characterizations. Plamonics : The collective excitation of plasmon resonances in metal nanostructures can act as optical antenna and localize electromagnetic energy on the nanoscale. The enhancement of local electric fields can be so strong that Raman scattering from single molecules becomes detectable. The plasmon resonance is also expected to dramatically enhance nonlinear optical response. We are investigating its manifestation and the optimal structure design using nonlinear spectroscopy in conjunction with theoretical modeling. Spectroscopy of Oxide Surface/Interface : With the development of epitaxial growth of oxides, many exciting and unexpected physical phenomena are being discovered at oxides interfaces. However, their physical understanding is hampered by a dearth of characterization tools capable of probing the buried interfaces. Second-order nonlinear spectroscopy, such as sum-frequency generation, is ideally suited for such study with its surface specificity and spectral resolution. We will apply it to investigate the electronic structure, vibrations and coupling between charge and lattice at oxide interfaces. Publications F. Wang , D. Cho, B. Kessler, J. Deslippe, P.J.

Professor Mathies’ has two research groups that are based on modern optical laser spectroscopic techniques. The “Raman Group” uses resonance Raman spectroscopy, femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, and the new technique called Femtosecond Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy (FSRS) to study chemical and biological reaction dynamics with a focus on the mechanism of photoactive proteins that mediate information and energy transduction. The “DNA/Microchip Group” exploits the sensitivity of laser excited fluorescence detection to develop high-performance microfabricated chemical and biochemical analysis methods and “lab-on-a-chip” apparatus. Excited-State Structure and Reaction Dynamics. Determining the structural dynamics of a molecule as it reacts is the key to understanding chemical reaction dynamics. While femtosecond electronic spectroscopy teaches us much about the kinetics of the electronic states involved, it is typically silent on the structure and structural evolution of the reacting species. Resonance Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful window on the structural dynamics of reacting molecules. The quantitative analysis of resonance Raman vibrational scattering intensities tells us about the excited-state structure and femtosecond reaction dynamics on the 0-50 fs time-scale. To extend these limits, we have recently developed the new time-resolved structural technique called Femtosecond Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy (FSFS) that provides high resolution vibrational spectra with unprecedented <50 fs time resolution. This method allows us, for the first time, to obtain vibrational structural spectra of molecules in the transition state as they react. These techniques are being used to study the photochemistry and photophysics of polyenes, retinals and retinal-containing pigments, and many other types of photochemically active systems exemplified by the visual pigment rhodopsin. Photochemistry of Vision. Visual excitation begins when a photon is absorbed by the 11-cis retinal chromophore in the visual pigment rhodopsin. The amazingly fast (200 fs) photoisomerization of retinal to the all-trans configuration drives conformational changes in the surrounding protein that excite the retinal rod cell. We are using a variety of low-temperature and ps-fs time-resolved spectroscopic techniques to determine how the excited-state isomerization occurs, how the protein catalyzes this process, how chromophore isomerization drives subsequent activating protein conformational changes on the ps-ns time scale, and how the protein controls the wavelength of maximum absorbance of visual pigments. Current projects include the use of site-specific mutants of rhodopsin coupled with FSRS studies of the reaction dynamics to understand the role of the protein in catalyzing this fast and efficient isomerization and energy conversion. We are also interested in understanding the photochemical mechanism of other light-sensing proteins such as phytochrome (a light sensor in plants) and bacteriorhodopsin (a light-driven proton pump found in halophilic bacteria. Microfabricated Bioanalysis Systems and Genomics We are working on the development of new analysis technologies that will advance genome sequencing, polymorphism characterization, proteomics and health care diagnostics. Toward this end we developed the first Capillary Array Electrophoresis instruments and the energy transfer dye label concepts that were used in the sequencing of the Human Genome. Our approach is to exploit miniaturization of chemical and biochemical analysis along with high-sensitivity fluorescence detection to produce integrated microfabricated lab-on-a-chip microanalysis systems. We are now going beyond the traditional lab-on-a-chip concept to the development of chemical and biochemical microprocessors. We have developed microphotolithographic methods for fabricating capillary electrophoresis systems on glass substrates or chips and the development of methods for DNA sample preparation on these devices. The advantages of these devices are that very small amounts of sample are needed, the electrophoretic separations are 10-100 times faster than conventional techniques, and miniaturization permits the fabrication of massively parallel analysis devices. Photolithographic CE systems have been fabricated and used to perform high speed DNA fragment analyses, PCR fragment sizing and DNA sequencing. Methods have also been developed for fabricating CAE chips with from 96 to 384 capillaries that are capable of analyzing large numbers of samples in parallel. We have also developed methods for integrating PCR-based sample preparation on these chips to make the first miniaturized DNA analysis bioprocessors. Future work will focus on the fabrication and operation of more complex DNA sample preparation and analysis systems including valves, vents, reactors, pumps etc. to perform nanoliter chemistries that would not be feasible or practical in a conventional macroscopic laboratory. Examples include the development of chips to evolve selected RNA populations automatically, the development of ultra-high gain cascaded PCR reactors, chips to perform analysis of single cell genetics and expression, the development of chip-based logic circuits using DNA as the information carrier in microfluidic channel \"wires\", the development of microchemical and biochemical analysis devices to explore for chemical signs of extraterrestrial life, and the development of portable clinical health care monitors.

       " 'Casey Law': 'Research Interests My research currently focuses on developing radio interferometers in the study of fast (subsecond) transients. Transients on this time scale are typically observed with large, single-dish radio telescopes or phased interferometers. My work is different in that I use the raw product of an interfermeter (visibilities) to search for fast transients. This effectively makes interferometers into high speed cameras that can find and localize radio transients over a wide field of view. At the Very Large Array (VLA), I am applying this concept to a 1 TB/hour data stream to search for Fast Radio Bursts, a potentially revolutionary new class of fast radio transient. This torrential data stream requires real-time transient detection algorithms in order to avoid being overwhelmed by the data deluge. I am also collaborating on a project to implement this real-time transient search algorithm to search VLA data commensally, that is, in tandem with other observations. Real-time, commensal transient searches will open up thousands of hours per year and allow us to find and identify the progenitors of FRBs, pulsars, and other classes of fast radio transient.',\n",
       " 'Lawrence Hall': 'Research Area(s): Particle Physics Biography Lawrence Hall received his B.A. from Oxford in 1977 and his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1981. He was a Miller Fellow at Berkeley from 1981-83, and a junior faculty member at Harvard from 1983-86. He has been on the Berkeley faculty since 1986. He received Sloan and Presidential Young Investigator Awards, and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. Research Interests What are the fundamental laws of nature, and how are they determined? The standard model of particle physics, while very successful, leaves many fundamental questions unanswered. These questions frequently have to do with symmetries: could certain aspects of particles and their interactions be better understood in terms of a new symmetry? How are these new symmetries, and indeed many of the symmetries of the standard model, to be broken? The symmetry of the electroweak interaction would imply that there is no difference between the left-handed neutrino and the left-handed electron! These particles differ only because the symmetry is broken -- and yet we do not know how this symmetry breaking occurs. The difference between the masses of the electron and the muon are a sign that flavor symmetries are broken; but again, the origin is unknown. It is remarkable that we can address such problems, and in the coming decade we shall find answers to at least some of the fundamental questions of symmetry breaking. In recent years I have constructed and studied theories with enhanced spacetime, gauge and flavor symmetries: supersymmetry, and compact extra spatial dimensions with size from sub-mm to inverse TeV to inverse Planck mass. I have worked on grand unified theories in four and higher dimensions, and have considered a variety of frameworks for neutrino masses. Recently I have focused on the TeV scale, since is the range of the Large Hadron Collider. Whether the electroweak symmetry turns out to be broken by supersymmetric interactions, a new strong force, or by extra spatial dimensions, the elucidation of the TeV scale will be as exciting as any previous discoveries in particle physics. The cosmos contains both dark energy and dark matter, dominating the contents of a critical universe. These contents of the universe, as well as the asymmetric baryons and background photons, arise from the underlying theory of particle and gravitational interactions. For all its successes, the standard model of particle physics does not allow the computation of the density of any of these components of the universe. What theory will? Symmetries have carried us far, but will they take us further? Recently I have explored the extent to which the questions that face us might be answered by environmental selection from a large landscape of vacua. Current Projects What will we discover at the LHC? There are many theories but no leading candidate; my latest theory is supersymmetric with a large Higgs interaction [1]. Using the physics of extra spatial dimensions, I have constructed a supersymmetric theory with a fifth dimension at the TeV scale that is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking [2]. This allows a prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson and for the pattern of the masses of the superpartners and KK resonances. I have introduced a new framework for grand unification, in which the unified symmetry is realized only in higher dimensions and the higher dimensional field theory allows a precise calculation of the weak mixing angle [3]. Such theories have new possibilities for understanding gauge symmetry breaking, quark and lepton masses and proton decay. Why are lepton-flavor mixing angles large while those in the quark sector are small? I am pursuing a variety of ideas to explain this quark-lepton asymmetry. Possible schemes for large mixing between the tau neutrino and the muon neutrino were explored in [4], and the possibility of a statistical understanding from the landscape in [5]. Cosmological data suggest that we live in an interesting period in the history of the universe when the matter, radiation and vacuum contributions to the energy density are broadly comparable. The occurrence of any epoch with such a \"triple coincidence\" is puzzling, and yet it appears that we happen to live during this special epoch. I have proposed why this might be so [6], and have proposed a theory that leads to such interesting times [7].

He is affiliated with UC Berkeley’s Programs in Medieval Studies and Religious Studies, and the Designated Emphasis in Critical Theory. After studying German Literature, Philosophy, and Russian in Zurich and Paris, Professor Largier received his Ph.D. from the University of Zurich in 1989. His research deals with the history of medieval and early modern German literature, especially questions of the relations among literature, philosophy, theology, and other fields of knowledge. His most recent books explore the relation between bodily ascetic practices (in particular flagellation), eroticism, and the literary imagination (Lob der Peitsche: Eine Kulturgeschichte der Erregung. Beck, Munich, 2001; American translation: In Praise of the Whip: A Cultural History of Arousal. ZONE Books, 2007; Spanish translation: Elogio del látigo: Una historia cultural de la excitación. Oceano, 2010), and the fascination of decadent literature with such religious practices (Die Kunst des Begehrens: Dekadenz, Sinnlichkeit und Askese. Beck, Munich, 2007). Current projects: the history of fantasy and the emotions from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era; the history of the senses, of sense experience, and of the stimulation of the senses-especially taste and touch-in medieval, early modern, and modern cultures. Niklaus Largier is an internationally recognized expert on mystical traditions in German literature and thought, in particular Meister Eckhart and his influence from the Middle Ages to postmodern discourses. His books include a study on time and temporality in late medieval philosophy and literature (1989), a bibliography of literature on Meister Eckhart (1989), a translation and commentary of a medieval treatise on spiritual poverty (1989), a two-volume edition of Meister Eckhart’s works with extensive commentaries in the Deutscher Klassiker Verlag (1993), and a study of the significance of exemplum and exemplarity in medieval literature, philosophy, and historiography (1997). Largier has published essays on Eckhart, Tauler, Seuse, Mechthild of Magdburg, Hadewijch, Rudolf of Biberach, Czepko, and others. More recently, a series of articles deals with the interaction of images and texts in medieval manuscripts, questions of visual culture, and the significance of exemplarity in various discursive contexts. He has coedited two collections of essays on spirituality and literature (1995 and 1999), and an important medieval collection of vernacular sermons (1998). Largier is a member of the editorial board of the journal Representations, and of the book series New Trends in Medieval Philology (DeGruyter, Berlin) and Deutsche Literatur von den Anfängen bis 1700 (Lang, Bern et al.).

He received a B.S. in mathematics from Harvey Mudd College, an M. Phil. in international relations from Cambridge, and his M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics from UC Berkeley. His published work includes Nuclear Deterrence Theory: The Search for Credibility , (Cambridge University Press, 1990); In the Shadow of Power: States and Strategies in International Politics (Princeton University Press, 1999); “Bargaining and Fighting While Learning,” American Journal of Political Science (April 2004); and “The Inefficient Use of Power: Costly Conflict with Complete Information\" American Political Science Review (May 2004). Books: In the Shadow of Power: States and Strategies in International Politics (1999) Robert Powell argues persuasively and elegantly for the usefulness of formal models in studying international conflict and for the necessity of greater dialogue between modeling and empirical analysis. Powell makes it clear that many widely made arguments about the way states act under threat do not hold when subjected to the rigors of modeling. In doing so, he provides a more secure foundation for the future of international relations theory. Powell argues that, in the Hobbesian environment in which states exist, a state can respond to a threat in at least three ways: (1) it can reallocate resources already under its control; (2) it can try to defuse the threat through bargaining and compromise; (3) it can try to draw on resources of other states by allying with them. Powell carefully outlines these three responses and uses a series of game theoretic models to examine each of them, showing that the models make the analysis of these responses more precise than would otherwise be possible. The advantages of the modeling-oriented approach, Powell contends, have been evident in the number of new insights they have made possible in international relations theory. Some argue that these advances could have originated in ordinary-language models, but as Powell notes, they did not in practice do so, The book focuses on the insight and intuitions that emerge during modeling, rather than on technical analysis, making it accessible to readers with only a general background in international relations theory.',\n",

Georgian Journal of American Studies 4 (Tbilisi, 2006). \\ufeff Current Research Edited Volume: Comintern Aesthetics It has long been common practice to see Western metropolises like Paris and New York as centers of global modernism and a “world republic of letters.” Comintern Aesthetics (co-edited with Amelia Glaser) seeks to provide an alternate mapping of world culture, one that decenters the West through an emphasis on the now-defunct realms of “really existing socialism” (a.k.a. “the Communist Bloc”), as well as on what might be called “diaspora socialisms.” More specifically, this edited volume will join scholars across national and regional contexts in order to re-assemble cultural and revolutionary circuits that once connected Moscow with, for instance, Beijing, Havana, and indeed, Paris and New York. The common thread is a shared encounter with leftist vanguards and avant-gardes—that is, artists and writers committed both to modernist experimentation and international revolution. The Soviet Union of the interwar years provided the template for this convergence of party politics and cultural history. However, the goal of the project is to trace how this template was adapted and reworked around the world. In 1919 Vladimir Lenin founded the Third Communist International, or Comintern, to coordinate world revolution, with a particular emphasis on Asia. At the same time, the experimental works of writers and artists like Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Vladimir Tatlin made it possible to assert Russia, not France, as the center of cutting-edge modernism. (Indeed, Tatlin’s famous proto-constructivist Tower was planned as both the Comintern’s headquarters and a counterpoint to the Eiffel Tower.) The key ingredient was the idea of revolution—the Soviet avant-garde’s union of artistic and political rupture; its ill-fated embrace of the Bolshevik vanguard. This convergence of vanguard and avant-garde—and, in particular, the Soviet turn from iconoclasm to socialist realism—has been thoroughly studied in works like Susan Buck-Morss’ Dreamworld and Catastrophe and Boris Groys’ The Total Art of Stalinism . What has been less-studied are the ways in which configurations of Comintern policies and radical aesthetics resonated and still resonate around the world. As Katerina Clark and others have shown, the Soviet Union of the interwar years attracted such luminaries as Lu Xun and André Malraux; Soviet Writers Congresses inspired India’s anti-colonial Progressive Writers Association; and socialist realism helped spur the creation of magical realism in Latin America. By emphasizing the shared, Soviet routes of these far-flung circuits, the project recaptures a long-lost moment in which cultures could not only transform perception, but also highlight alternatives to capitalism—namely, an anti-colonial world imaginary foregrounding race, class, and gender equality. Though the project highlights both the political and cultural missteps in the attempt to form a unified Comintern Aesthetics, it also shows how this alternate imaginary still circulates through such forms as postcolonial novels and films, as well as contemporary art and activism. In short, the volume will provide a comprehensive account of the rise, fall, and afterlives of Comintern Aesthetics. The result will be a literary atlas of sorts—a new world map based on shared historical paths not overtly taken. \\ufeff Recent English Courses Taught Spring, 2017 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 166AC/1 Special Topics in American Cultures:  Literatures of the Asian Diaspora in America American Cultures American Literature Asian American Literature Fall, 2016 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 250/2 Research Seminar:  Ethnic Modernisms African American Literature Chicana/o and/or Latina/o Asian American Literature World Literature Literary Theory Graduate Courses Spring, 2016 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 45C/2 Literature in English:  Mid-19th through the 20th Century Introductory Surveys 45C/201 -- discussion section Bondy, Katherine Isabel 45C/202 -- discussion section Taylor, Bradford Alden 45C/203 -- discussion section Catchings, Alex 190/11 Research Seminar World Literature Research Seminars Fall, 2015 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 45C/1 Literature in English: Mid-19th Through the 20th Century Introductory Surveys British 20th- and 21st-Century American Literature 45C/101 -- discussion section Miller, Jasmin 45C/102 -- discussion section Catchings, Alex Spring, 2015 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 133T/1 Topics in African American Literature and Culture:  Black Internationalism African American Literature World Literature 190/6 Research Seminar:  Literature and Revolution World Literature Research Seminars Show ALL Courses Back',\n",

       " 'Michael S. Witherell': 'Research Area(s): Particle Physics Biography Michael Witherell is Director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Professor of Physics. Previously he was Vice Chancellor for Research and held the Presidential Chair in Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and before that he was Director of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). Witherell received his B.S. from the University of Michigan and his Ph.D. in experimental particle physics from the University of Wisconsin. He then served on the faculty at Princeton and at UC Santa Barbara. He won the W. K. H. Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics from the American Physical Society in 1990 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1998. Research Interests Witherell has done particle physics research at accelerators and underground. His current research is part of the campaign to observe the interactions of dark matter particles with ordinary matter. He is working on the LUX (Large Underground Xenon) experiment, which is now operating in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He is a member of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) collaboration, which is building a much more sensitive experiment to start operating at SURF in 2019. He is interested in pursuing the search for neutrinoless double beta decay using LZ, in addition to the dark matter search for which it was principally designed. Publications D. S.

       " 'Irfan Siddiqi': 'Research Area(s): Condensed Matter Physics And Materials Science Biography Irfan Siddiqi received his AB (1997) in chemistry & physics from Harvard University. He then went on to receive a PhD (2002) in applied physics from Yale University, where he stayed as a postdoctoral researcher until 2005. Irfan joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley in the summer of 2006. In 2006, Irfan was awarded the George E. Valley, Jr. prize by the American Physical Society for the development of the Josephson bifurcation amplifier. In 2007, he was awarded the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award, the Hellman Family Faculty Fund, and the UC Berkeley Chancellor’s Partnership Faculty Fund. Research Interests Current Projects Quantum mechanics is a theory that was developed to explain the properties of atoms and light. It is one of the most thoroughly tested and successful theories in the history of science. It is also one of the most controversial ones. For over 80 years, quantum mechanics has stirred up deep debate amongst physicists, in particular about the notion that an object can be in a coherent superposition of two states simultaneously. Moreover, since the mass of an object does not directly enter into the quantum formalism, the theory should be applicable to all objects in the universe, thus raising deep philosophical questions about how then one obtains classical behavior if the word is actually quantum. Our group, the Quantum Nanoelectronics Laboratory, investigates the quantum coherence of various condensed matter systems ranging from microscopic nanomagnets such as single molecule magnets to complex macroscopic electrical circuits. To measure the electric and magnetic properties of these quantum systems, we are developing novel microwave frequency quantum-noise-limited amplifiers based on superconducting Josephson junctions formed by both oxide tunnel barriers and carbon nanotube weak links. Current topics of research include the dependence of quantum coherence on system complexity, the non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics of non-linear oscillators, the quantum coherence of single molecules, and topological architectures for maximum coherence in superconducting circuits.

My first book, Imperial Ideals in the Roman West (Cambridge, 2011),examined the figure of the Roman emperor as a unifying symbol for the western empire, and argued that the widespread circulation and replication of a particular set of imperial ideals, and the particular form of ideological unification that this brought about, not only reinforced the power of the Roman imperial state, but also increased the authority of local aristocrats throughout the western provinces, thereby facilitating a general convergence of social power that defined the middle Roman empire. I have also written on and maintain interests in the material and visual cultures of the Roman empire; the topography and urban history of the city of Rome; textual production and aristocratic self-representation in the early empire; political thought in the Roman world; and comparative empires. Current projects includea short book for Princeton University Press on thehistorical sociology of the early Romanempire; a series of articles on the institutions and ideologies of the Han and Roman empires; andan edited volume for Bloomsbury Academic UK, A Cultural History of Western Empires in Antiquity.

Her work focuses on the development of management practices and seeks to blend methods and insights from business history, economic history, and labor history. Her current book project, tentatively titled From Slavery to Scientific Management (under contract at Harvard University Press)investigates the complex relationship between slavery and capitalism in American history. Traditional narratives in business and economic history begin in the factories of England and New England, extending only much later to the American South. From Slavery to Scientific Management begins instead, on West Indian sugar plantations in the late eighteenth century, tracing the development of business practices forward to the rise of Taylorism in the early twentieth century.

       " 'Nicole King': 'Nicole King Contact Info Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and  Professor of Genetics, Genomics and Development* *And Affiliate, Division of Cell and Developmental Biology Lab Homepage: http://kinglab.berkeley.edu/ Full Directory Information Research Interests The origin of animals represents one of the pivotal transitions in life’s history, and one of its greatest unsolved mysteries. While the fossil record remains silent regarding the rise of multicellularity, the genetic and developmental foundations of animal origins may be deduced from shared elements among extant animals and their protozoan relatives, the choanoflagellates. To better understand the origin and evolution of animals, we are: reconstructing the minimal genomic complexity of the unicellular progenitors of animals elucidating the ancestral functions of genes required for animal development characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying choanoflagellate cell/developmental biology and the interactions between choanoflagellates and bacteria Current Projects Cell biology and colony development in choanoflagellates: The mechanisms by which choanoflagellates form multicelled colonies, establish cell polarity, and reproduce may provide crucial insights into the transition to multicellularity, but little is known about their cell biology or natural history. We have recently discovered that there is an unexpected amount of cell differentiation during the life history of the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta , including the formation of at least two different multicellular colonial forms. These colonies form through a process of incomplete cytokinesis (rather than cell aggregation) such that the mature colony is a clonal individual. In addition, neighboring cells in colonies are linked through fine intercellular bridges that may permit direct sharing of small molecules. Our next goals are to investigate the genetic determinants of cell differentiation and colony formation, through the use of RNA-Seq approaches and the development of genetic screens. Interspecies interactions in choanoflagellates : Our studies of the choanoflagellate S. rosetta have revealed that its ability to form rosette-shaped colonies is regulated by a chemical signal synthesized by prey bacteria from the genus Algoriphagus . Given the close evolutionary relationship of choanoflagellates to animals and the experimental tractability of the S. rosetta - Algoriphagus interaction, this pairing holds great potential for revealing fundamental mechanisms linking inter-kingdom signaling to morphogenesis. We have been collaborating with the Clardy lab at Harvard Medical School to isolate and identify the bacterially-produced signaling molecule. In addition, we have developed genetic approaches in Algoriphagus to dissect the necessary biosynthetic pathway. Moving forward, a major goal is to isolate the S. rosetta receptor that allows it to perceive and respond to the Algoriphagus signal. Using comparative genomics to investigate the ancestral animal genome : A key question in the origin of animals concerns how and when the “toolkit” of animal genes was assembled. To test whether genes required for animal development evolved before the origin of animal multicellularity, we have sequenced the genomes of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis and S. rosetta (in collaboration with the JGI and Broad Institute) and are currently preparing to sequence the transcriptomes of 19 additional cultured choanoflagellates as part of the Moore Foundation/NCGR Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome project . Genes shared only by choanoflagellates and animals were likely present in their common ancestor and may shed light on the transition to multicellularity. This work has already provided evidence that choanoflagellates express members of diverse protein families (e.g. receptor tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and C-type lectins) required for animal cell signaling and adhesion. Investigating the ancient functions of genes required for multicellular development : The finding of signaling and adhesion gene homologs (e.g. cadherins, receptor tyrosine kinases, and protooncogenes) in choanoflagellates raises questions about how these genes functioned in the unicellular common ancestor of choanoflagellates and animals, and what role they played in the origin of multicellularity. By focusing on the study of cadherins, we have identified a set of previously unidentified cadherin families that were present in the last common ancestor of animals and their last common ancestor with choanoflagellates (the “urchoanimal”). In addition, we have found that the important regulatory interaction between the transcription factor Max and its binding partner Mad evolved before the origin of animals. Inferences about gene function in diverse choanoflagellates provide an important reference point for studies of gene family evolution in animals.

Lehman': 'Professor Emeritus Email: slehman@berkeley.edu Phone: (510) 642-5893 Full Contact Information > Research Description In the Motor Control Lab, we ask questions on the human scale, and answer them at the most direct level, from cell to intact person. We use mathematical models to integrate results from the cell to the intact animal. We have investigated questions from the control of the simplest voluntary movements to the rehabilitation of stroke patients by robots. The questions of immediate interest are: How do muscles stop movements? and How does repetitive motion relate to muscle fatigue and to repetitive motion disorders? A key aspect of the control of voluntary movements and locomotion is force production by muscles that are used as brakes. To find out how muscles act as brakes to stop movements, we do experiments on single muscle fibers in vitro. We characterize the biomechanics of muscle fibers, build mathematical models that simulate those mechanics, and test the models by varying the physical and chemical environment of the fibers. Our research agenda is to characterize force production, energy storage and dissipation, then to extend the fiber model back up to the whole animal scale, iteratively comparing model predictions to experiments at each stage. With the redesign of workplaces and work, ergonomists have begun to take an interest in fatigue that arises from non-forceful repetitive work. This may be the most common type of fatigue in the modern workplace. Currently we do experiments on intact people to test whether fatigue is an indicator of cumulative repetitive work. This is the first stage in a long term plan to find the connection between fatigue and repetitive motion disorders. Selected Publications Dickinson, M.H., C.T. Farley, R.J. Full, M.A.R. Koehl, R.

Current projects are focused in three areas; 1) elucidating the structures, functions, and dynamics of biomolecules and their macromolecular complexes with emphasis on protein sequencing, conformational elucidation, and protein-protein interactions, 2) understanding ion solvation, how water organizes around different ions and how water affects molecular structure and intermolecular interactions. Competitive interactions between ions, water, and biomolecules of interest are investigated by probing ions in size-selected trapped nanodrops using spectroscopy and ion-electron recombination experiments and 3) developing new instrumentation to analyze complex mixtures, including contents of cells, using microfabricated devices coupled with mass spectrometry and developing probes for rapid chemical analysis of surfaces with high sensitivity. A number of different types of state-of-the-art mass spectrometers and lasers are used in these studies.

Pattern and Process of Fungal Evolution. We study the pattern and process of fungal evolution. We started by studying the pattern of evolution in terms of species and populations and now have begun to study the process. Our long term goal is to make fungi the best models for evolutionary biology. We focus on the key evolutionary event that forms the tree of life: speciation. Recently we have documented species divergences, compared phylogenetic and biological methods of species recognition, addressed the timing of species divergence, and evaluated selection acting on potentially adaptive genes. Now, we are using genetics and genomics to find genes that maintain species and facilitate adaptation. Figure 1. Bayesian phylogeny made from exon sequence from Neurospora crassa isolates showing two, genetically differentiated populations in what had been thought to be one population. Comparison of the genomes of the Louisiana and Caribbean (dotted line) populations revealed the \"islands of differentiation\" seen in Figure 2. (Ellison et al. 2011. PNAS 107:2831-2836). Figure 2. Island of differentiation. (A. chromosome 3, B chromosome 7) uncovered by genome scans of Neurospora crassa individuals from the Louisiana (LA) and Caribbean (Carib) populations.Genes in these islands are candidates for those important to adaptation. The mean annual low temperature in Louisiana is 10 degrees Clower in than the Caribbean and,using growth as a measure of fitness, Louisiana individuals were more fit than Caribbean individuals at low temperature. A Louisiana strain with a gene deletion for PAC 10 (prefoldin) or for MRH4 (RNA helicase) also showed lower fitness than wild type at low temperature, leaving intact our hypothesis that genes in the islands are important for adaptation to growth at low temperature.

B.Arts&Sci. McMaster University 1998 Research Pseudomonas syringae uses the syringe-like Type III Secretion System (T3SS) to inject Type III Secreted Effector (T3SE) proteins into the plant host. The primary role of T3SE proteins is believed to be the suppression of innate immunity. Recognition of effector proteins by the host Resistance (R) proteins results in the initiation of defense responses, including the hypersensitive response (HR). The pathogen can then evolve or acquire new T3SE proteins that evade the host defense response. Given these dual roles of virulence and defense induction, T3SEs provide excellent tools to probe innate immunity in plants. My lab focuses on identifying new components in innate immunity and understanding their roles in defense, using a wide variety of experimental approaches.

Donald Terner Distinguished Professor of Affordable Housing and Urban Policy; Faculty Director, Terner Center Education Master of City and Regional Planning, University of California, Berkeley Bachelor of Arts, Ohio Wesleyan University Biography Carol Galante is the I. Donald Terner Distinguished Professor in Affordable Housing and Urban Policy and the Faculty Director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. She also co-chairs the Policy Advisory Board of the Fisher Center of Real Estate and Urban Economics. As Faculty Director of the recently launched Terner Center for Housing Innovation, Galante is positioning the Center to be a new leading voice in the formulation of practical solutions and policies to meet the challenges of developing homes and communities that are affordable, vibrant and environmentally sustainable. The Center will generate constructive strategies for public policy makers and innovative tools for private sector partners, and work with students to cultivate the next generation of leadership in housing and the built environment. Preceding her appointments at UC Berkeley, Galante was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal Housing Commissioner at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Prior to her confirmation, Ms. Galante served as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Housing/FHA Commissioner, having first joined HUD in May 2009 as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing programs. As FHA Commissioner, Ms. Galante had direct responsibility for oversight and administration of the FHA’s trillion dollar insurance portfolio, which includes single family and multifamily housing as well as insured health care facilities. She was also responsible for several of HUD’s rental assistance programs, including 1.2 million units of Project Based Rental Assistance, and over 400,000 apartments for elderly and the disabled under the Section 202 and 811 programs. Galante served as FHA Commissioner during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and one precipitated by the housing market collapse. Galante provided key leadership in the housing sector including strengthening FHA’s infrastructure and policies while providing access to credit that helped stabilize the housing market. She also developed signature initiatives that provided better opportunities to low income families including Choice Neighborhoods and the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program. Prior to her appointment at HUD, Galante was President and Chief Executive of BRIDGE Housing Corporation, the largest non-profit developer of affordable, mixed-income and mixed-use developments in California. BRIDGE is a hybrid organization blending the best of business practices and entrepreneurial ideas with a mission to create affordable homes and apartments. Prior to BRIDGE she was the Executive Director of Eden Housing, Inc. Galante has also worked for local government in city planning and community economic development. She has held numerous volunteer leadership positions in organizations such as the Housing Partnership Network, OneCalifornia Bank Foundation, California Housing Consortium, Center for Creative Land Recycling, Center for Housing Policy, and Urban Land Institute. She has been the recipient of many notable honors, including: Housing Wire Magazine’s Influential Woman in Housing 2012, Multifamily/Developer Magazine-Executive of the Year in 2008, Builder Magazine-Top Most Influential People in Homebuilding in 2006, and the California Homebuilder Hall of Fame.

Botany, University of Minnesota, St. Paul B.S. Forest Science University of Minnesota, St. Paul, 1978 Research Fungal Ecology and Systematics Fungal Biology is the core interest of my lab, and in a world where organismal-based science and “ologies” have fallen out of favor I make no apologies for my focus on Mycology. Within this broad area my primary focus has been fungal ecology, and most of my work in this area has been at the community ecology or autecology levels. This is an important area of work because fungi play pivotal roles in all terrestrial ecosystems, and they are grossly understudied relative to their importance. Our prior work was primarily on ectomycorrhizal fungi and was focused on: 1) the development of molecular tools for the identification of fungi from environmental samples; 2) the determinants of fungal community structure; 4) the autecology and population structure of key ectomycorrhizal fungal species; and 5) the ecology and evolution of non-photosynthetic, epiparasitic plants and their fungal hosts, 6) structure, behavior and function of ectomycorrhizal spore banks. 6) landscape level patterns of spore dispersal and tree recruitment, and 7) population genomics of Suillus brevipes . Current Projects Funded projects in the lab (as of June 2016) have shifted toward saprobic communities. These include 1) autecology and function of pyrophilous fungal communities (DOE); 2) dynamics of microbial communities in the indoor environment (Sloan Foundation). We are also involved with collaborative work on Suillus species with the Kennedy, Nguyen, and Vilgalys labs, and Cat Adams, a graduate student in the lab, is working on Amanita phalloides, the invasive death cap. The lab also interacts with citizen science groups such as the North American Mycological Association, The Bay Area Mycological Society, The Mycological Society of San Francisco, and the Sonoma Mycological Association. These groups have been instrumental in cataloguing and vouchering the macrofungi of Pt. Reyes National Seashore, Yosemite National park, and North America at large.

       " 'Tyrone B. Hayes': \"Professor Email: tyrone@berkeley.edu Phone: (510) 643-1055 Full Contact Information > Research Description My research focuses on the role of steroid hormones in amphibian development and I conduct both laboratory and field studies in the U.S. and Africa. The two main areas of interest are metamorphosis and sex differentiation, but I am also interested in growth (larval and adult) and hormonal regulation of aggressive behavior. My work addresses problems on several levels including ecological, organismal, and molecular questions. In my work on metamorphosis, I study a local toad (Bufo boreas). Studies examine the effects of temperature on developmental rates, interactions between the thyroid hormones and steroids, and hormonal regulation of skin gland development. I am also examining the effects of tadpole density on developmental rates and measuring metamorphic rates and hormone levels of tadpoles in the field and in the laboratory. My work on sex differentiation involves the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), the Japanese kajika (Buegeria buegeri), and the Pine Barrens treefrog (Hyla femoralis). While Xenopus serves as a good model because of its availability, the latter two species have genetically distinguishable sexes. I can therefore examine early events in gonad differentiation, steroid enzyme activities, steroid receptors, etc., knowing the genetic sex of the individual larvae. Currently, I am also examining the effects of exogenous steroids on gonadal differentiation and the potential role of endogenous steroids. My main goal is to synthesize ecological/evolutionary, organismal/physiological, and biochemical/molecular studies to learn how an animal translates changes in its external environment to internal changes, how these internal changes are coordinated, what molecular mechanisms are involved, and in turn, how changes at the molecular level affect an animal's ability to adapt to the changes in its external environment.

My research investigates how authors effected and experienced these changes. I am especially interested in how religious ideals and practices participate in the transformations of the period – how they at times fuel, and at times resist secularization. Much of my work concentrates on the intersection between literature and religious practice, in particular on the relationship between prayer, meditation, spiritual exercises and poetry. I have published on religious and secular concepts of attention, on apocalypse as a literary and political figure, and on philosophy of history and comparative literature. My first book Death Be Not Proud: The Art of Holy Attention (Chicago, 2016) reads John Donne's Holy Sonnets as a site where the bonds between premodern devotional, literary, and philosophical investments in attentiveness become visible. The question of when and why prayer requires attentiveness has led me to my current project, which focuses on prayer in the aftermath of the Reformation. \\ufeff Specialties \\ufeff Drama Renaissance and Early Modern Critical Theory Poetry \\ufeff Books Title Fields Death Be Not Proud: The Art of Holy Attention The seventeenth-century French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche thought that philosophy could learn a valuable lesson from prayer, which teaches us how to attend, wait, and be open for what might happen next.Death Be Not Proudexplores the precedents of Malebranche’s advice by reading John Donne’s poetic prayers in the context of what David Marno calls the “art of holy attention.”\\t\\tIf, in Malebra....

McGuire': 'Associate Professor Email: mcguirej@berkeley.edu Phone: (510) 316-6201 Lab Webpage: http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/mcguire/ Full Contact Information > Research Description As an Integrative Biologist, my research seeks to connect four fundamental aspects of the evolution of organismal diversity: (1) lineage diversification, (2) historical biogeography, and the influence of (3) morphological and (4) molecular evolution on organismal performance. Although there are a number of approaches that one may utilize in order to gain insight into these processes, my research program is firmly rooted in phylogenetic systematics with a more recent foray into population genetics. Because phylogenetics underpins so much of my research, I have a fifth area of interest - the theory and practice of phylogenetic systematics. Thus, I would describe myself as a phylogenetic systematist with expertise in molecular genetics, phylogenetic comparative methods, and theoretical aspects of phylogenetic analysis, with a strong and growing interest in molecular population genetics. Two major projects underway in my lab right now include (1) an analysis of the historical biogeography of Sulawesi frogs, lizards, and monkeys based on phylogenetic and coalescent-based population genetic analyses of multilocus sequence data, and (2) a study investigating the molecular evolution of hummingbird globin genes and their relationship with respiratory physiological performance across altitudinal gradients. Much of my research is dependent upon fieldwork and I maintain an active field program in Southeast Asia. The herpetofauna of Southeast Asia is among the least known and most endangered on the planet and I plan to direct most of my field efforts toward this region for the foreseeable future. Although students with interests close to my own (both conceptually and geographically) are welcome in my lab, I encourage my students to develop independent research programs.

His interest areas include Soviet and Post-Soviet/Russian politics and foreign relations. He teaches courses on Soviet and Post-Soviet politics and foreign policy and in April, 1997, he was a recipient of the Distinguished Teaching Award from the Division of Social Sciences. In July 1998, he was appointed Chancellor\\'s Professor at UC Berkeley for combining distinguished achievement at the highest level in research, teaching, and service. In August 1999, he was appointed Dean of the Social Sciences Division in the College of Letters and Science. His publications include Krushchev and Brezhnev as Leaders (London: Allen and Unwin, 1982); \"Evaluating Gorbachev as Leader,\" Soviet Economy (Oct-Dec 1989); and \"Counterfactual Reasoning in Western Studies of Soviet Politics and Foreign Relations,\" in P. Tetlock and A. Belkin, eds., Counterfactual Thought Experiments in World Politics (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996). In July 2006, Prof. Breslauer was appointed Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost,the Chief Academic Officer of the Berkeley campus. Books: Gorbachev and Yeltsin as Leaders (2002) How did Gorbachev and Yeltsin get away with transforming and replacing the Soviet system and its foreign relations? Why did they act as they did in pushing for such radical changes? And how will history evaluate their accomplishments? In this unique and original study, George W. Breslauer compares and evaluates the leadership strategies adopted by Gorbachev and Yeltsin at each stage of their administrations: political rise, political ascendancy, and political decline. He demonstrates how these men used the power of ideas to mobilize support for their policies, to seize the initative from political rivals, and to mold their images as effective problem solvers, indispensable politicians, and symbol of national unity and élan. Gorbachev and Yeltsin as Leaders also compares these men with Khrushchev and Brezhnev, yielding new insight into the nature of Soviet and post-Soviet politics and into the dynamics of \"transformational\" leadership more generally. The book is an important contribution to the analysis and evaluation of political leadership. It is exceptionally well written and accessible to the nonspecialist. Soviet Policy in Africa: From the Old to the New Thinking (1992) During Spring 1991, the fall of Mengistu\\'s government in Ethiopia, and the victory of insurgent forces in that country, along with an agreement between the MPLA and UNITA to end the Angolan civil war, symbolized an end to a decade-and-a-half of regional conflicts in which the superpowers had become heavily engaged.

       " 'Scott Saul': '\\ufeff Scott Saul Professor D29B Hearst Field Annex Friday 10 am-noon at Cafe Milano ssaul@berkeley.edu \\ufeff Professional Statement I enjoy writing for both academic and popular audiences. My latest book, BECOMING RICHARD PRYOR (HarperCollins, 2014), offers the first deeply researched account of the great performer\\'s life. More information about me and the book can be found at www.scott-saul.com . BECOMING RICHARD PRYOR also has a digital companion at www.becomingrichardpryor.com :a fully curated, multi-media website that opens up the biographer\\'s workshop and gives everyone access to the materials I\\'ve uncovered — over 200 documents — from Pryor\\'s first two decades in Peoria, Illinois. My interests run to the great cultural watershed that was modernism in the arts -- whether it took the form of William Carlos Williams\\'s poetry, Charlie Chaplin\\'s films, or Duke Ellington\\'s music -- and to the starburst of creative activity that has followed up to the present.I\\'m especially interested in the connections between 20th-century artistic movements and 20th-century social movements — or, on the individual level, how particular artists are catalyzed by the history they are living through. I generally teach courses in 20th-century American literature and cultural history, ranging from \"The Culture of the Cold War\" and \"The Seventies\" to \"Fictions of Los Angeles,\" \"American Avant-Gardes\" and \"Race and Performance in the 20th-century U.S.\". I also am host of \"Chapter & Verse,\" a books-and-arts podcast.

My first book, Freedom Is, Freedom Ain\\'t: Jazz and the Making of the Sixties , offered a new account of the cultural transformation of \"the sixties\" by putting the music of jazz -- and all the artists and activists inspired by the music -- at the center of that story. For more on the book, including an excerpt, see the publisher\\'s website at: http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/SAUFRE.html \"The Humanities in Crisis? Not at Most Schools.\" New York Times , July 3, 2013. In this op-ed I countered the myth of the humanities\\' decline by drawing on two things: my own experience teaching English majors at UC-Berkeley, and the statistical record. \"A Player\\'s Life\" (biographical essay on Richard Pryor). No Pryor Restraint: Life in Concert (Shout! Factory, 2013). I was thrilled to contribute an extensive essay to this definitive (seven-CD and two-DVD) boxed-set of Pryor\\'s stand-up performances. \"\\'Etc., Etc.\\': The Post-Punk Ballad of Rodger Young.\" The Daniel Clowes Reader (Fantagraphics, 2013). I was honored to be included in this collection, a wonderful critical edition of Ghost World and other important pieces by the great contemporary cartoonist. A decent-sized sample of the book can be found here . \"Off Minor\" (review of Robin Kelley, Thelonious Monk: An American Original ). Boston Review , Sept.-Oct. 2010. Using Robin Kelley\\'s magisterial and definitive biography of jazz pianist Thelonious Monk as my jumping-off point, I consider the surprising twists and turns of Monk\\'s life and try to pin down the elusive intelligence of his music. Humor, wit and pathos were braided together in Monk\\'s music -- and, as Kelley suggests, they were braided together in his life as well. \"A Body on the Gears\" (review of Robert Cohen, Freedom\\'s Orator: Mario Savio and the Radical Legacy of the Sixties ). The Nation , March 29, 2010. The activist-intellectual at the center of Berkeley\\'s Free Speech Movement, Mario Savio helped ignite campuses across the US and set the tone of the New Left. Yet Savio\\'s own personal story has for too long been untold. Here I reflect on the roots of Savio\\'s activism and on its legacy, given the crisis facing public higher education in California today. \"Suspended Sentences\" (review of several books by essayist-critic Eliot Weinberger). The Nation , Oct. 19, 2009: 33-37. Eliot Weinberger has been experimenting in ingenious ways with the form of the nonfiction essay for over two decades now, bringing it into the orbit of poetry and magical realism, but it\\'s his recent political commentary that has gained him greater renown. Here I try to bring together the \"two Eliot Weinbergers.\" \"Gridlock of Rage: The Watts and Rodney King Riots.\" In The Blackwell Companion to the History of Los Angeles (Blackwell, 2011). Here I survey the historical literature on these two cataclysmic events , which have served as Exhibit A for any number of theories on the state of black America and the fate of America\\'s cities, and offer some suggestions for future research. \"Off Camera: Civil Rights in the North\" (review of Thomas J. Sugrue, Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North). The Nation, June 22, 2009: 25-31. Sugrue\\'s encyclopedic history of the Civil Rights movement in the North seems likely to become the standard reference point for future discussions of the Northern wing of the movement.In this review-essay I try to encapsulate how the book, in an understated but powerful way, shifts our understanding of the movement, even as it has trouble meeting the narrative challenges it takes on. \"Protest Lit 101\". American Literary History 21:2 (Summer 2009), 404-417. How to teach the dynamic between art and social movements? Here I meditate on the juggling act required in the classroom, reviewing two anthologies and one critical survey. Find my essay at http://alh.oxfordjournals.org . “Sweet Martin’s Badass Song” . The Nation, May 19, 2008: 36-41. In this omnibus review of several new books on Martin Luther King\\'s life, I reflect on some less-known aspects of King: his skill as a rhetorician, a speaker with a keen ability to tune his message to the needs of his different audiences, and his commitment to remedying class inequality in America. “Brazil’s Dreamer: The Disenchantment and Reenchantment of Chico Buarque”. Boston Review , June/July 2007, 35-38. Working at the crossroads of bossa nova and Brecht, Carnival and Kafka, Chico Buarque is perhaps Brazil’s most celebrated living artist; he was once called “the man every woman wanted to marry and every man wanted to emulate.” Here’s my appraisal of his album \"Carioca\" and his first three novels . “On the Lower Frequencies: Rethinking the Black Power Movement”. Harper’s Magazine , December 2006, 92-98. More and more historians are starting to question the morality play that has structured the way we remember the Civil Rights and Black Power movements – and I have to agree with the impulse, though it makes the Black Power movement all the more difficult to encapsulate in an image or catchphrase. See my review (available to Harper’s subscribers) of two recent Black Power books at: http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/12/0081318 \"Fade to White”. Bookforum , Oct./Nov. 2005, 41-43.This essay, which reconsiders the deaths at Jonestown and the lead-up to that tragedy, is available at Rebecca Moore’s extensive website on the Peoples Temple at: http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/AboutJonestown/JonestownReport/Volume7/11-02f-Saul.pdf \"An Uneasy Embrace\" (Review of Chen Shi-Zheng, \"Peach Blossom Fan\" at CalArts). Theater , 2005 (35:1), 98-101. Chinese-born director Chen Shi-Zheng, in collaboration with Magnetic Fields songwriter Stephen Merritt and playwright Edward Mast, produced a postmodern musical version of Kung Shang-Ren’s 1699 play. See my review at: http://theater.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/citation/35/1/98 “The Seductions of Caetano Veloso”. Raritan , Spring 2005, 45-69.Caetano Veloso is one of the world’s great songwriters, a musician who has nimbly managed to be both an unstoppable provocateur and an expert craftsman of love songs. Here’s a one-stop introduction to Veloso’s music and the Brazilian cultural revolution he helped spark.(Article available via WilsonWeb) \"The Devil and Henry Dumas\". Boston Review , Oct.-Nov. 2004. Writer Henry Dumas—fantasist, fabulist, dark comedian—offers another perspective on the character of the Black Arts Movement. “’Mirage or No Mirage’: Reading Los Angeles”. Boston Review , Dec. 2003-Jan. 2004, 41-44.A consideration of the mythologies of Los Angeles, inspired by David Ulin’s edited collection Writing Los Angeles : http://www.bostonreview.net/BR28.6/saul.html Review of Ruben Martinez, Crossing Over: A Family on the Migrant Trail, Boston Review , February-March 2002. 62-63.

The book traces Pryor\\'s journey from a childhood spent in Peoria’s red light district to his arrival in the 1970s as the “funniest person on the planet” and one of Hollywood’s most unlikely and unforgettable stars. It is impossible to imagine the art of stand-up comedy without Pryor, its most versatile and charismatic figure. More than any previous comedian, he used the intimate details of his own life — his addictions, his relationships, his traumas — as the foundation of his act and the starting-point for his exploration of the meaning of America. Becoming Richard Pryor suggests that, for all the power of that stage act, it was always a refraction of his life, never the life itself. The life itself was a story so harrowing that it often couldn’t be processed into stand-up, even by the comedian who opened stand-up to the darkest of impulses. His stage act was in so small part an act of will, an assertion of control over a private world where control was in short supply. \\ufeff Recent English Courses Taught Fall, 2016 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 143N/3 Prose Nonfiction:  Covering Culture Creative Writing Workshops 174/1 Literature and History:  The Seventies American Literature Film Special Topics Spring, 2016 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas H195B/2 Honors Course Honors and Tutorial Courses Fall, 2015 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas H195A/2 Honors Course Honors and Tutorial Courses Spring, 2015 Course & Section Course Name Course Areas 174/1 Literature and History:  The Seventies American Literature Novel Film Show ALL Courses Back',\n",

Broadly, we are interested in understanding how genetic variation in natural populations is shaped by the interplay of migration, mutation, selection, recombination, drift, and changes in population size. We study the genetic details of how new species arise as well as the genetics of adaptation. Most of our work is on mammals with a particular emphasis on humans and mice. Major current projects include: (1) environmental adaptation in introduced populations of house mice across the Americas, (2) the genetic basis of reproductive isolation between closely related lineages, and (3) the genetic basis of color variation in desert rodents. We use a variety of approaches including field work, controlled crosses in the laboratory, genomic tools, molecular biological approaches, and computational analysis of large datasets.

I am particularly interested in unconscious mental life, as manifested in implicit memory and related phenomena, although my view of the unconscious departs radically from the standard Freudian, psychodynamic view. Since the beginning of my career I have been engaged in the study of hypnosis, which I view as an altered state of consciousness that occurs within a particular interpersonal setting. In the study of social cognition, I am particularly interested in the self as a social-cognitive knowledge structure representing one’s knowledge of oneself, acquired through experience and encoded in memory; and in the application of neuropsychological paradigms to the study of personality and social interaction (though I remain skeptical of much of what passes for \"social neuroscience\"). Together with Nancy Cantor (Syracuse University), I have promoted a \"social intelligence\" approach to personality, which argues that the important individual differences in personality lie in the funds of procedural and declarative knowledge that people bring to bear on their interactions with others. I have initiated a project, the Study of the Human Ecology of Memory , whose aim is to use the theme of memory to link psychology to the other social sciences, and to the arts and humanities. This enterprise is intended as a counterweight to the biological focus characteristic of cognitive neuroscience. Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Lucy Canter Kihlstrom and the Institute for the Study of Healthcare Organizations & Transactions , I have become interested in issues related to health cognition and behavior, inclouding compliance with medical regimens, the use of hypnosis as an adjunctive treatment for pain and other medical problems, the placebo effect, and psychosomatic interactions. I believe that health psychology errs in focusing so narrowly on stress and disease, and that it should try to understand how people think about health and illness, and how their beliefs affect their interactions with healthcare providers and other components of the healthcare system. place Selected Publications Kihlstrom, J.F.

       " 'Raphael Bousso': 'Research Area(s): Particle Physics Biography Raphael Bousso received his Ph.D. from Cambridge University in 1998 and went on to become a Post-doc at Stanford University. He also worked at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara. In 2002/03 he was a fellow at the Harvard University physics department and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In July 2003 he joined the physics department at UC Berkeley. Research Interests My interests are in theoretical cosmology and quantum gravity. The central principles of quantum mechanics and of general relativity (our classical theory of gravity) come into sharp conflict at the horizon of a black hole. Quantum mechanics rests on the principle of unitarity: information cannot be fundamentally lost. General relativity is based on the equivalence principle: empty space should look the same everywhere and to everyone. Black holes evaporate, converting their energy into a cloud of radiation. Quantum mechanics requires this cloud to contain information: in principle, we could measure the cloud and use a powerful computer to reconstruct what formed the black hole. Meanwhile, in general relativity, the horizon of a black hole is empty space, so it should look the same as empty space everywhere else. It turns out that these two demands are mutually exclusive. Either information is lost, or the horizon of a black hole is a special place called a \"firewall\". Hawking went with the equivalence principle and famously predicted that information is lost. But since then, evidence has accumulated that unitarity must be upheld. For some time, it was believed that an idea called \"black hole complementarity\" would resolve the conflict. Bob, who waits for the black hole to evaporate, recovers information; whereas Alice, who jumps into the black hole, notices nothing special at the horizon. There is no real contradiction, since Alice cannot get out of the black hole and argue with Bob. They just have two very different descriptions of the black hole. Very recently, however, we have come to realize that complementarity falls short: it cannot fully resolve the conflict between unitarity and the equivalence principle. This is a real crisis, and it presents an opportunity for dramatic progress: some deeply held belief about quantum mechanics or gravity will have to be abandoned. Much of my research focusses on understanding the firewall paradox and its consequences. I am also interested in extracting predictions from the landscape of string theory. String theory predicts an enormous universe containing diverse regions, each larger than the observed universe. This is currently the only known explanation of the small value of the observed cosmological constant (or \"dark energy\"), and of the fact that it is comparable to the energy density of matter. The landscape can also explain other coincidences, such as the fact that dark and ordinary matter have comparable abundances. A central challenge in cosmology is the \"measure problem\": the need to regulate infinities that come from indefinite exponential expansion, known as eternal inflation. This problem arises independently of the landscape: because the cosmological constant is positive, our own observable universe will expand in this way in the future.

Research Nancy Scheper-Hughes\\' research, writings, and teaching focus on violence, suffering, and premature death as these are experienced on the margins and peripheries of the late modern world. For the last decade she has been involved in a multi-sited, ethnographic, and medical human rights oriented study of the global traffic in humans (living and dead) for their organs to serve the needs and desires of international transplant patients. She continues to conduct research on transitional violence, justice, and reconciliation in the slums , shantytowns, and squatter camps of Brazil and South Africa, in particular the rise of police-supported death squads in neo-liberal democracies in the \\'developing world\\'. Profile Nancy Scheper-Hughes is Professor of Medical Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley where she directs the doctoral program in Critical Studies in Medicine, Science, and the Body. Scheper-Hughes\\' lifework concerns the violence of everyday life examined from a radical existentialist and politically engaged perspective. Her examination of structural and political violence, of what she calls \"small wars and invisible genocides\" has allowed her to develop a so-called \\'militant\\' anthropology, which has been broadly applied to medicine, psychiatry, and to the practice of anthropology. She is perhaps best known for her books on schizophrenia among bachelor farmers in County Kerry (Saints, Scholars and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Rural Ireland) and on the madness of hunger, maternal thinking, and infant mortality in Brazil (Death without Weeping: the Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil). During the early 1980s she undertook an ethnographic study on the deinstitutionalization of the severely mentally ill in South Boston and on the homeless mentally ill in Berkeley. In 1994-1995 Scheper-Hughes moved to South Africa to take up a temporary post as Chair of Anthropology at the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of Cape Town during the political transition. While there she began an on-going ethnographic study of the role of political and everyday violence in the pre and post-transition periods. She has written a series of essays to be published under the title Undoing: the Politics of the Impossible in the New South Africa. Her most recent books are: Commodifying Bodies (co-edited with Loic Waquant), 2002, London: Sage (Theory, Culture and Society series). (Commodifying Bodies will appear later this year in an Italian edition with Ombre Courte, Verona, Italia); and Violence in War and Peace: an Anthology (co-edited with Philippe Bourgois), 2003, London and Malden, Mass: Basil Blackwell. Scheper-Hughes has conducted research, written on, and been politically engaged in topics ranging from AIDS and human rights in Cuba, death squads and the extermination of street kids in Brazil, the Catholic Church, clerical celibacy, and child sex abuse, to the repatriation of the brain of a famous Yahi Indian, Ishi (kept as a specimen in the Smithsonian Institution) to the Pit River people of Northern California. Her most recent research is a multi-sited ethnographic study of the global traffic in humans for their organs which she interprets as a form of invisible and sacrificial violence. Her next book, The Ends of the Body: the Global Traffic in Organs, is to be published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. She is co-founder and Director of Organs Watch, a medical human rights project and she is currently an advisor to the World Health Organization (Geneva) on issues related to global transplantation. Scheper-Hughes has lectured internationally and has been a research professor in residence at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences in Paris in 1993 (and will take up that post again in the fall of 2004). Read the Berkeley News article, UC Berkeley anthropology professor working on organs trafficking, dated April 30, 2004. The RTE Irish public TV series \"What in the World\" featured a documentary on December 23, 2013 looking at the global business of illegally brokered and trafficked organs for transplants between the USA and Isreal. Professor Nancy Scheper-Hughes is interviewed about the first person, Izak Rosenbaum, to be convicted of human organ trafficking in the US.

       " 'Jennifer Johnson-Hanks': 'Professor Research Interests: Population, culture, family Office: 484 Barrows Curriculum Vitae: JJH_2016.pdf Profile: Jennifer Johnson-Hanks ethnographer and demographer of family and the life course. Her research focuses on the relationship between population rates and cultural patterns, and on the mediation of that relationship by (individual?) intentional action. Papers in Current Anthropology and the American Journal of Sociology , for example, askhow are individual actions coordinated into stable rates, such as birth rates or marriage rates? What roles do individual intentions play in accounting for action, and in the formation of rates? And conversely, how are intentions and demographically relevant actions socially and culturally structured? Her first book , Uncertain Honor , was published by the University of Chicago Press in 2006. It explores the relationship between population rates and cultural practices through a study of the transition to motherhood among educated women in Southern Cameroon. Integrating demographic and ethnographic evidence and theory, Uncertain Honor argues that the certain young Cameroonian women delay motherhood as part of a broader attempt to assert a modern form of honor only recently made possible by formal education, Catholicism, and economic change. Co-authoring with Phil Morgan, Chris Bachrach, and Hans-Peter Kohler, Johnson-Hanks published Understanding Family Change and Variation: Toward a theory of Conjunctural Action in 2011. Itargues that social demography has moved too far away from core debates in social theory, and must be reintegrated. The book then poses a framework through which that reintegration can occur. This framework posits that material and schematic structures profoundly shape the occurrence, frequency, and context of the vital events that constitute the object of social demography. Fertility and family behaviors are thereforebest understood as a function not just of individual traits, but of the structured contexts in which behavior occurs. Johnson-Hanks is currently working on a third book, tentatively titled Sex in Public: Population and the Paradox of Choice. This book begins with the apparent dilemma that no-onecommits suicide because fewer people than average have done so in this calendar year; no one has an unwanted pregnancy in order to offset the thwarted intentions of the infertile. And yet, rates of suicide remain stunningly flat, and (in the US at least) observed births match the desired number of births almost exactly. How does this happen? The question here is not only how individual desires or intentions are brought in line with culturally normative ones, but also how the distribution of intentions, actions, and outcomes is sustained over time.The book is about quantification in the social sciences, about what happens when we count social things. What is at stake in asking social science questions in numerical ways? What can be gained? And what risks does counting imply? Johnson-Hanks earned her BA from Berkeley, and her MA and PhD from Northwestern, all in Anthropology. She is joint appointed in the Departments of Sociology and Demography, and currently serves as Associate Dean of Social Sciences.

       " 'Han N. Lim': \"Assistant Professor Research Description Genetically identical individuals are never phenotypically identical even in the same environment. How does this non-genetic, phenotypic variation arise and what are the consequences for the survival of the individual and of the population? These are fundamental questions in evolution, organismal development and disease. My lab's research examines how the complex interplay between genetics, epigenetic mechanisms, environment and stochastic fluctuations generate non-genetic, phenotypic variation. In particular, we are interested in the design features of biological networks that minimize and/or enhance phenotypic variation in bacterial populations that are involved in: cellular decision-making and differentiation; cooperation in bacterial communities; and the regulation of specialized functions required for bacterial pathogenesis. To reveal these design features we use a combination of experimental and theoretical tools to identify how the components of natural circuits work together. In addition, we gain valuable information by constructing artificial networks with novel properties and applications. The results of these studies will be applied to the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat two major problems in modern medicine; bacterial biofilm formation and antibiotic persistence/resistance.

This, in addition, to even more impressive developments algorithms allow us to obtain unique insights in the molecular behavior of many systems of scientific and technological interest. A central theme in our research is trying to understand how the environment influences the properties of these systems of interest. Experimentally it is very difficult to obtain information on molecules adsorbed in the nano-pores of a zeolite. From a scientific point of view it is important to understand how the environment is influencing the properties of these molecules. For these applications we have developed accurate models of the interactions between the molecules that allow us to mimic the experimental situation and to predict experimental properties, like, diffusion coefficients or adsorption isotherms. As the majority of the constituents of many everyday materials, from gasoline to a plastic PET bottle, have seen the inside of a zeolite catalyst, providing these molecular insights is not only of scientific importance. Proteins or peptides in a membrane have a very different environment from proteins in the cell. To understand how proteins interact in a membrane, multi-scale computational approaches are developed that allow us to study the effects of changes in the membrane structure on the collective behavior of these molecules.

We study the molecules and mechanisms that govern epithelial polarity, cell shape, and tissue morphogenesis, often using forward genetic screens in Drosophila as entry points. We also seek to understand how epithelial organization promotes the proper control of organ growth, a surprising connection uncovered by our analysis of fly tumor suppressor genes that represents a general principle relevant to human cancer. Finally, we use Drosophila cancer models as a simple system to understand how tumors actually kill their hosts. Current Projects How is the polarity of epithelial cells established and maintained? Epithelial cells constitute the most widespread and evolutionarily ancient mode of animal tissue organization. The functions of epithelia rely on their highly polarized architecture, in which specific proteins are restricted to apical, junctional, and basolateral surfaces. We are working to understand the mechanisms that regulate cell polarity, exploiting our discovery of the Scribble module that acts to distinguish the epithelial basolateral domain by antagonizing the apical Par/aPKC complex. Cell biological assays of protein trafficking and biochemical studies of Scribble module partners are revealing their mysterious basic polarizing activities. As novel insights can come from unbiased genetic screens, we have designed several to isolate new regulators of epithelial polarity. These screens identify genes that directly interface with the conserved polarity regulators, revealing mechanistic links with basic membrane trafficking, RNA localization, and protein degradation machineries. Through this, we seek to expand existing paradigms of epithelial polarity and obtain an integrated picture of how the cell achieves the proper apicobasal distribution of proteins. How does epithelial polarity influence tumorigenesis, and how do tumors kill their hosts? The final size of animal organs is tightly regulated. How epithelial cells communicate to measure organ size, and to make a communal decision to cease proliferation, is an outstanding mystery. We are exploring the unknown pathways that control organ size, and in particular how the unique features of epithelial architecture restrain excess growth. Cell polarity and proliferation appear coupled in a number of contexts,and disruption of epithelial polarity correlates with the progression of malignant tumors, but the causal mechanism has been obscure. In Drosophila, mutations in Scribble-like polarity regulators induce fly ‘neoplastic tumors’ that share characteristics with malignant human tumors, including an inability to exit the cell cycle, failure to differentiate, loss of epithelial structure, and the acquisition of invasive capabilities echoing metastasis. We are currently using this system to address questions including: Why does control of organ size require epithelial organization? What factors lie downstream of neoplastic tumor suppressors to prevent malignancy, and what are the signaling pathways through which these factors are controlled? How do the pathways misregulated in tumorous growth relate to those that normally control wound healing and regeneration? Finally, we have found that fly tumors also induce tumor-host interactions resembling those seen in human patients, including cachexia and early death --can the fly model shed light on mechanisms by which tumors actually kill? These questions are being pursued through both hypothesis-based and discovery-driven approaches. What molecules and forces control the shape, organization, and movement of epithelial tissues? In addition to static aspects of epithelial architecture, we are interested in how epithelial cells and sheets organize themselves to drive the morphogenetic outcomes that shape organs and organisms. The ovarian (follicle) epithelium of Drosophila is a rich system for such studies, whose conserved morphogenetic behaviors determine the final three-dimensional form of the mature egg. We are using cell biological, live imaging, and biomechanical approaches in conjunction with forward genetic screening to understand the morphogenetic processes that sculpt this simple organ. One current focus is the mechanisms underlying tissue elongation, an elemental morphogenetic change that requires activities in both the epithelium and the surrounding extracellular matrix. These activities include a dramatic, planar-polarized collective cell migration in the Drosophila follicle that rotates the entire tissue. We are studying the origin and coordination of this migration, themolecular mechanisms that coordinate planar polarity in this ‘edgeless epithelium’, and how theycreate anisotropic biomechanical forces that shape the organ.

Bentley': 'Associate Professor Email: gb7@berkeley.edu Phone: (510) 542-8004 Lab Webpage: http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/bentley/ Full Contact Information > Research Description How does the external environment cause hormonal changes within an individual? How does the brain detect and interpret external cues, integrating them into endocrine physiology? How does bird song cause rapid changes in circulating sex hormones? Why do soccer fans have higher testosterone when their team wins than when it loses? Despite huge advances in our understanding of biology as a whole, we still know very little about how the brain regulates an animal\\'s constantly fluctuating endocrine status to keep it in tune not only with the physical environment but also the social environment. Of course, we know that the hypothalamus is the key to all changes hormonal. We know that physical stimuli (water, salt balance, pain) can elicit hormonal changes to maintain allostasis, and the pathways involved have been relatively well mapped-out. However, the less tangible stimuli, such as auditory and visual cues, pheromones, temperature and light intensity, have been less well-studied. Our understanding of how these cues are a) detected and b) transduced into hormonal signals is minimal. Endocrine and behavioral responses to stimuli such as vocalizations have been documented for decades, yet the \"black box\" approach has been applied to any explanation of the brain\\'s involvement. Any external stimulus has to be first monitored by and then responded to by the brain for the stimulus to have a physiological effect. To affect the reproductive axis, these stimuli must influence the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) system. Yet, the focus has been on the end-point of this type of study (i.e., effects upon peripheral hormones and/or behavior). Of course, anthropomorphically speaking, the behavioral endpoint is all that matters as far as the individual involved is concerned: \"Do I get my mate\" \"Did I scare off an intruder?\", but how the brain (and the GnRH system) has adapted to effect these responses is rather more important from an evolutionary point of view. This is where my interests lie. Students and postdocs are encouraged to learn a multitude of molecular, cellular, physiological and surgical techniques to investigate: neuroendocrine control of reproduction and reproductive behaviors; biological rhythms; neuroplasticity in the avian brain; immune function and breeding strategies. These can often be applied in a field situation to get an idea of how complex biological organisms operate in the \"real\" world. Selected Publications Ubuka, T., G.E. Bentley, K. Ukena, J.C.

My approach to studying these areas is heavily influenced by social-cognitive theory and methods, such as work on knowledge accessibility and dual-process models. In my view, merging social cognition with the self, close relationships, and intergroup relations is useful because it highlights the fundamentally social nature of perceiving, interpreting, judging, and behaving. Social Bases of the Self I am especially interested in studying how one\\'s relationships with significant others and one\\'s group memberships influence self-definition, self-evaluation, and self-regulation. For example, a colleague and I have recently proposed a framework to study the relational self, or the self in relation to significant others. We argue that the phenomenon of transference (see below) plays a major role in shaping the nature of the self in the course of everyday life. Our theory accounts for both stability and malleability in the relational self, and leaves room for social bases of the self beyond significant others, such as the social groups to which one belongs. Multiple Levels of Self-Definition A related interest focuses on the notion that there are multiple levels of self-definition, such as the individual, relational, and collective levels. For decades, the literatures on individual, relational, and collective selves have grown independently, with each emphasizing a particular set of perspectives and methods. However, an increasing number of researchers have begun to consider different selves within a single framework, or to apply similar concepts across selves. Several of my projects fit this trend. For example, my graduate students and I are examining in what ways self-verification theory, originally formulated at the individual level of self-definition, extends to the collective self. In another line of work, we are examining factors that predict self-regulatory shifts in self-definition, as well as how and among whom such shifts occur. Significant-Other Representations and Transference My interest in significant others is also reflected in my work on transference, which refers to the phenomenon whereby aspects of past relationships with significant others resurface in relations with new people. I conceptualize transference in social-cognitive terms, arguing that it reflects the activation and use of a significant-other representation in social perception. In one line of research in this area, I have been examining the hypothesis that perceivers are especially likely to explain their significant others in terms of their psychological or mental states, and, accordingly, that such \"psychological-state theories\" are particularly powerful triggers of transference. Social Power Relationships involving power asymmetries are the focus of several other lines of research, each guided by the broad question: What are the cognitive, motivational, and behavioral effects of power? To study this question, I take a Person x Situation approach in which power\\'s effects are seen as a function of both personality and situational variables. For example, we have examined individual differences in relationship orientation as a moderator of the effects of situational power. Currently, we are building on this work by examining the joint role of self-construals and gender in predicting how power influences those who wield it. place Selected Publications Chen, S. & Boucher, H.C., & Tapias, M.P.

Szeri is a Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. Professor Szeri received his B.Sc. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1984 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Cornell University in 1987 and 1988. After postdoctoral appointments at Caltech and at U.C. Santa Barbara, he joined the faculty at UC Irvine in 1991, moved to UC Berkeley in 1997, and was promoted to the rank of Professor there in 2003. Professor Szeri teaches in the areas of fluid mechanics and nonlinear dynamics. He has won four teaching awards, including two Tau Beta Pi teaching awards at UC Berkeley. His research is focused on the development and exploitation of mathematical insight in application areas from physics of fluids to medical devices and treatments; he works closely with a number of experimentalists and clinicians. The current areas of interest focus on solute transport: air-sea exchange of heat and mass; respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in alveoli; delivery of anti-HIV microbicides; and insulin delivery and control systems for an artificial pancreas. Recent interest has been in medical acoustics (destruction of kidney stones by shock waves, clot dissolution by high-intensity focused ultrasound, and diagnostic ultrasound contrast agents) and computational neuroscience (synchronization, sleep dynamics, optogenetics, and seizure dynamics and control). These research topics build on earlier work in nonlinear hydrodynamic stability, complex fluids, charged particle dynamics, and cavitation physics. Professor Szeri has mentored more than 20 Ph.D. students to completion, who went on to occupy positions at national labs (LLNL, LANL), companies (LG, Apple, Tokyo Electron, SAIC), and universities (including UC Irvine, UCSD, UCSF, USC, CSU Fullerton, Boston University, University of Connecticut, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Harvard University, Olin College, Nazarbaev University, and Rutgers University). Former students have won awards such as NSF CAREER, PECASE, and the Burroughs-Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface. Professor Szeri has won several research awards, including a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, a Chaim Weizmann Research Fellowship in Applied Mechanics at Caltech, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award, and a Research Fellowship in physics from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Germany). He is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America. In his academic administrative appointments at UC Berkeley, Professor Szeri served two years as Associate Dean and then seven years (2007-14) as Dean of the Graduate Division, with primarily quality assurance and financial responsibilities extending to nearly 11,000 graduate students and 100+ degree programs campus-wide. For two years (2014-16) he served as Vice Provost for Strategic Academic and Facilities Planning, leading academic program review of all departments and schools at UC Berkeley, overseeing space planning, administering several interdisciplinary programs holding faculty appointments, and planning for a set of initiatives that contribute to the campus’s continued excellence while providing a firmer financial foundation. Professor Szeri also served (2011-16) as Faculty Head of the Operational Excellence Program, which successfully implemented 20+ projects reforming campus-wide administrative operational systems for email, calendar, document sharing, finance, timekeeping, procurement, data warehouse, and also made structural changes in campus administration in an effort to improve operations and contain escalating costs. Professor Szeri’s external appointments have included service as the Board Chair of the GRE Program of the Educational Testing Service, service as a reviewer of Institutional Strategies of German universities for the Excellence Initiative on behalf of the German Science and Humanities Council, and service as a member of the Research Grants Council—which oversees research expenditures and policy matters for the major research universities of Hong Kong. He served on the editorial board of the Springer-Verlag Journal of Nonlinear Science for more than twenty years, and has completed a decade of service on the editorial board of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. Among his most satisfying experiences have been several engagements as a medical volunteer with Project Angkor in Cambodia.

Drawing from core disciplines of chemistry and molecular biology, as well as emerging fields spanning chemical biology to nanoscience, we develop new tools for molecular imaging, chemoproteomics, and optogenetics to identify and study novel chemical signals in biology, with a particular focus on neuroscience, metabolism, and cancer. Representative project areas under current investigation are summarized below. Current Projects The Chang Lab, 2015 Transition Metal Signaling. The traditional view of metals in biology is that redox-inactive alkali and alkaline metals like sodium, potassium, and calcium are broadly used for cell signaling, whereas redox-active transition metals like copper and iron are solely metabolic cofactors that must be buried and tightly-bound within protein active sites to protect the cell from potential oxidative stress and damage. Our work breaks this narrow mold by establishing a new paradigm of transition metal signaling, where these essential nutrients can also serve as dynamic cellular messengers. We are developing fluorescent, bioluminescent, and PET probes to image transition metal pools, chemoproteomics probes to identify and characterize new metalloprotein targets, and optogenetic constructs to manipulate transition metal signals in cell, tissue, and zebrafish and mouse models. These chemical tools are being applied to study the contributions of transition metal signaling to fat metabolism in obesity, diabetes, and cancer along with neural circuitry. Metals in Neurobiology. The unique biology of the brain as the center of consciousness, from learning and memory to senses like sight, smell, and taste, is underpinned by unique chemistry that remains insufficiently understood. In particular, we are interested in understanding why the brain accumulates unexpected chemical elements at higher concentrations than any other organ or tissue, including redox-active metals like copper and iron, where at the same time these elements are misregulated in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\\'s and Parkinson\\'s diseases and autism. Using CRISPR, optogenetics, high-resolution mass spec imaging, and behavioral assays, we are developing and studying new zebrafish and mouse models to explore the roles of transition metals in neural signaling and neurodegeneration. Redox Imaging, Proteomics, and Optogenetics. Oxidative stress is the result of unregulated production of reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of oxidative damage over time leads to the functional decline of organ systems. The biology of reactive oxygen species and their sulfur and carbon counterparts is much more complex, however, as emerging evidence shows that small oxygen, sulfur, and carbon metabolites, such as hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen sulfide, and formaldehyde, can mediate beneficial cellular signal transduction cascades when produced in the right place, at the right time, at appropriate levels. We are synthesizing small-molecule fluorescent, MRI, and PET imaging probes that exploit chemoselective, bioorthogonal chemistries to report on specific analytes in living cells and animals, with particular interest in the redox biology of reactive oxygen, sulfur, and carbonyl species. We are also developing new bioconjugation reactions for chemoproteomics as well as small-molecule inhibitor and antibody-drug conjugate therapeutics. Finally, we are creating optogenetic tools for controlling redox signals that govern information transfer in neural circuits in live-cell culture and mouse models. Materials Biology for Solar Energy Conversion. Our work at the materials biology interface is inspired by natural photosynthesis, which harnesses solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water to the value-added products needed to sustain life; however, the chemical end products are limited to biomass, a complex mixture required to make the plant\\'s food and body. We are developing a hybrid inorganic-biological approach that can go beyond natural photosynthesis by creating cyborg cells that are capable of synthesizing a specific complex chemical product from carbon dioxide and water with sustainable solar and/or electrical input, spanning next-generation biofuels, sustainable foods, medicines, and biodegradable materials. In the longer term, this materials biology platform has the potential to endow photosynthetic capabilities to any living cell or organism.

Cho Professor Research Interests: Social theory, political economy, East Asia Office: 486 Barrows Profile: John Lie (pronounced \"Lee\") was born in South Korea, grew up in Japan and in Hawaii, and attended Harvard University where he received A.B. magna cum laude in Social Studies in 1982 and Ph.D. in Sociology in 1988. Currently he is C.K. Cho Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Taking literally C. Wright Mills\\'s notion of the sociological imagination to study the intersection of biography, history, and social structure Lie\\'s sociological imagination trilogy has explored his Korean origins and Korean diasporic trajectories. The trilogy includes Blue Dreams: Korean Americans and the Los Angeles Riots (with Nancy Abelmann, Harvard University Press, 1995), Han Unbound: The Political Economy of South Korea (Stanford University Press, 1998), and Multiethnic Japan (Harvard University Press, 2001). A recent addition to this corpus is Zainichi (Koreans in Japan): Diasporic Nationalism and Postcolonial Identity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008). An envoi, The Korean Diaspora , is forthcoming. Lie\\'s main scholarly interest is social theory. After working on a reconceptualization of \"markets,\" he sought to rethink the categories of modern peoplehood - race, ethnicity, and nation - which was published as Modern Peoplehood (Harvard University Press, 2004).He is currently working on a systematic work of social theory, tentatively entitled The Consolation of Social Theory. In addition, he is completing a series of books on topics that have bedeviled him: violence, democracy, and the modern (global) university. He also serves on the editorial board of over a dozen journals. Lie has also devoted considerable energy to undergraduate teaching and academic administration. His interest in pedagogy has culminated in an introductory textbook, Sociology: Your Compass for a New Century (with Robert Brym, Wadsworth, 2003), which has been translated into many languages. From 2004 to 2009, he was the Dean of International and Area Studies at Berkeley. Before joining the Berkeley faculty, Lie was Head of Sociology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for five years, and directed the Center for Japanese Studies and the Korean Studies Program at the University of Michigan. In addition to Illinois and Michigan, he has taught at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Yonsei University (South Korea), University of Oregon, Keio University (Japan), National Taiwan University, University of Waikato (New Zealand), Harvard University, and several others institutions around the world. Finally, Lie has longstanding interests in imaginative literature, philology, musicology, oenology, gastronomy, and bibliography.

University College London, 2000 Urban geography, simulation and modeling, geospatial technologies, Spatial analysis, GIS 589 McCone Hall 510-642-3903 dosullivan@berkeley.edu A visualization of openflights data using graph drawing My research and teaching interests are eclectic, perhaps because I came to geography late with a first degree in engineering science. I am an urban geographer, with a particular interest in novel (and mixed!) geographic methods. Some common threads are fundamental concepts in spatial analysis, modeling and visualization, and the implications of geospatial technologies, computation, and especially, the complexity sciences , for how we can and should represent the world. How can we use the geographical representations we make to do geography, particularly (but not exclusively) urban and human geography? At the most general level I explore relationships between spatial structures and processes using the simulation models of complexity science. At heart this is the central idea of my recent book Spatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process . Dynamic spatial models focus attention on the neighborhood as a fundamental spatial concept. More concretely, this interest owes a great deal to growing up in the 1970s and 80s in Belfast (Ireland), a place where local urban geographies mattered a great deal. I have worked on measuring and modeling neighborhood characteristics in urban settings, particularly patterns of ethnic settlement. This research highlights the importance of scale to understanding segregation: for example, in US cities quite different scales are evident in the segregation from other communities of African-American compared to Asian and Hispanic groups. I am fascinated by urban change, particularly the spatial dynamics of rent, and how capital flows in contest with local communities, produce and remake urban landscapes over time. Sitting at the boundary between quantitative and qualitative methods, I am intrigued by how narratives can be constructed using simulation models and have argued for narrative approaches to the analysis of models. This is shaky ground from a philosophy of science perspective. Statistical methods are how we traditionally cope with the biases of narrative explanations, but a lesson from complexity science is that a pervasive feature of geographical systems is how they scale up from local events to wider effects, strengthening the persuasiveness of narrative explanations. Finding ways to balance narrative explanation with statistical methods is an area for further research. Looking ahead, a key challenge is to understand how near-ubiquitous geospatial technologies (cellphones, the Internet, web-mapping, GPS) actively shape the sociospatial (urban) world. Spatial search, geo-tagging, and location-based services alter how places are perceived, locking-in misconceptions, and creating new perceptions. Notions such as ‘hotspots’—whether of crime, ill-health, or poverty, but rarely, if ever, of wealth—increasingly, ironically, have broad effects on policy, as ‘targeting’ turns communities into ‘segments’, neighborhoods into ‘lifestyles’, and people into ‘profiles’. Studying these phenomena requires theoretical insight and technical expertise, and I am enthusiastic about developing both, in collaboration with colleagues and students, at all levels.
