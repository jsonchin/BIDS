    "### Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Classify grants as expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "Faculty already have their expertise defined but possibly have 'sub-expertise' or 'hidden expertise' that are related to what they do that they might be interested in\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Jerry's code to match\n",

    "\n",
    "### Current task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Look into:\n",
    "\n",
    "word2vec titles to vector space\n",
    "\n",
    "Then feed in word2vec title vectors into neural net to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possibly use word2vec vector as well as simple contained in word or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph connectivity between expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. Someone who specifies their expertise might be interested in RNA so it might be worthwhile to put a weak signal for RNA in their profile vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a list of expertise fields to use for faculty and for grants (decide whether or not to remove those that only have one faculty member)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finished tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Match past grants to faculty profiles by merging dataframes\n",

    "\n",
    "Streamline of data (for a live system):\n",
    "- Grants\n",
    "    - grants.gov\n",
    "    - Pivot has more grants but has a no data mining policy (which is a problem if this system is used by Berkeley)\n",
    "- Faculty Profiles\n",
    "    - vcresearch.berkeley.edu\n",

    "    - Do people in the field generally like certain things?\n",
    "        -Government as their sponsor/want lots of grant money/cross-research/etc\n",
    "- Past research\n",
    "    - Analyze content of research news/name of research/categories of research\n",
    "    - Do they do cross-field research?\n",
    "    - Cost of grants of past research\n",
    "    - Change over time of research concentration (ex. very first was bio, then bio tech, then tech)\n",
    "    - Who did they work with/their fields of research\n",
    "- Years of being a faculty/researcher (might make them more set on a certain field like Abbeel)\n",
    "\n",
    "Grants classification (goal: besides list of categories/find hidden traits):\n",
    "- Category of funding\n",
    "- Grant money\n",
